            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I was expounding the <hi>17.</hi> and <hi>19.</hi> Chapters of this Propheſie of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> and ſaw an end put to Kingly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Judah, (for after <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> there was no ſtrong rod to be a Scepter to rule) my thoughts ran much upon that antient Propheſie, <hi>Gen. 49.10. The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feete, untill Shilo come.</hi> Concerning which, though ſome-what were then ſaid, yet I ſhall now endeavour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie both you and my ſelfe more fully. The words ſeeme to imply a preſence of the Scepter in the hand of Judah when they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth; becauſe a thing cannot be ſaid to depart from any hath it not: but it was long after ere the Tribe of Judah had any Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Jacob's</hi> meaning was, that the Scepter ſhould come in time to that Tribe, and when it came, it ſhould not depart; for <hi>Jacob</hi> propheſies of things to come. They were at that time in <hi>Aegypt</hi> few, poore, and low; and when they were encreaſed, they had no Scepter amongſt them, they were under the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Scepter, and had <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Task-maſters over them. After the LORD had brought them out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by a ſtrong hand, there was a Scepter and Law-giver amongſt them; but it was <hi>Moſes</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> Exod. <hi>21.10.</hi> And after him <hi>Joſhuah</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Numb. <hi>13.8.16.</hi> All that Judah had was
<pb facs="tcp:61577:3"/> a little priority in pitching his Standard and Camp firſt, <hi>Numb. 2.3.</hi> in ſending the firſt Prince to offer at the Dedication of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>Num. 7.12.</hi> In marching firſt from Sinai to Paran, <hi>Num. 10.14.</hi> In having the firſt lot when the Land of Canaan was divided, <hi>Joſh. 15.</hi> and in going up firſt to fight againſt the Canaanites, <hi>Judg. 1.2.</hi> And when account was taken of the Genealogies, Judah car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the preheminencie, being firſt numbred, <hi>1 Chr. 2.3.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the days of the Judges, who bare the Scepter <hi>339.</hi> or <hi>362.</hi> or <hi>370.</hi> years as the accounts of Chronologers are, or about <hi>450.</hi> as the Apoſtles account is, <hi>Act. 13.20.</hi> There were but two of the Tribe of Judah. <hi>Othniel,</hi> Judg. <hi>3.9.</hi> who was of that Tribe, as appears, <hi>Joſh. 15.17.20. 2 Chron. 4.1.13.</hi> and <hi>Ibzan</hi> who was of Bethlehem, <hi>Judg. 12.8.</hi> The following Judges were of other Tribes: and when it came to Kingly power, the firſt ſet up was <hi>Saul,</hi> who was a Benjamite, <hi>1 Sam. 9.1, 2.</hi> The next was <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the Bethlehemite, <hi>1 Sam. 16.1.</hi> It was now between <hi>6.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Helvicus.</note> and <hi>700.</hi> yeares from the time of <hi>Jacob's</hi> giving out this Prophecy, all which time it lay as dead and deſtitute of Regall power; which now being ſetled in this Tribe, continued but to the Captivity of <hi>Zedekiah, 468.</hi> as ſome do chronologize <hi>473.</hi> years, as others. The firſt King the <hi>Jewes</hi> had, God gave them in his wrath, <hi>1 Sam. 8.</hi> and the laſt hee tooke away in his fury. Judah that had been his pleaſant plant, was pluckt up in fury, <hi>Ezek. 19.12.</hi> and all the branches of that Vine pluckt off, and not one left to hold the Scepter, <hi>Jer. 22.30.</hi> Therefore ſome <hi>Jewes</hi> and others deriving the word <hi>Shiloh</hi> from <hi>Shalach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galatinus, l. 4. c. 4. cited by <hi>Amama. Lyra</hi> in locum.</note> render the words <hi>donec veniat mittendus,</hi> and ſo interpret this Propheſie of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar,</hi> who was ſent of God to deſtroy Judaea, and ſo the Scepter departed from Judah. But the next words in the Propheſie confute this interpretation, <hi>and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be. Shiloh</hi> was he that the Nations ſhould deſire, and unto whom the people ſhould be gathered, which never was verified in <hi>Nebuchadnezar.</hi>

               </note> which it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly notes, as <hi>Pſal. 45.6. Zach. 10.11.</hi> It may be granted that now the Scepter departed from Judah; for it's ſaid <hi>Ezek. 20.27.</hi> It ſhall be no more untill he come, whoſe right it is, and I will give it him, and that was Chriſt: from the putting down of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and the death of his ſons, none had right to Kingly power till Chriſt came. Now the Crown was laid aſide, and laid up for his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and no others. But if we take <hi>Shebet,</hi> or <hi>Shevet</hi> for a Tribe as it is <hi>Joſh. 3.12: 7.14. Pſal. 122.4. Jacob's</hi> ſenſe in the Propheſie is, that the Tribe of Judah ſhould not ceaſe, however it fared with other Tribes, till <hi>Shiloh</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> came. Tenne of the other Tribes were carryed away Captive by <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and never returned more; but as for that of Judah, though it were carryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Babylon, yet it was preſerved there, and return'd againe to it's owne Land, with few of any other Tribe. It was that Tribe chiefly which made up the Eſtate and Church, and continued till Chriſts comming.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe is true, but reaches not fully the ſcope of <hi>Jacob</hi> in this Propheſie; which is not ſimply to ſhew the duration of the Tribes, but the peculiar Benedictions they ſhould have: and Judah's was the Scepter, which doth not only note royall power, but any rule, dominion, or authority, as <hi>Iſa. 14.5. Ezek. 19.11.</hi> And ſo that Tribe ſhould have power, more or leſſe till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came; if not Kings, yet Law-givers; if not ſupream, yet ſubordinate power. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the captivity of the tenne Tribes, Kingly power was onely and eminently in it for <hi>130.</hi> yeares and upwards: and after <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi> down-fall (although it loſt royall dignity,<note place="margin">In captivate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonica ſemper capita &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes ſuos habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it ex ſemine. <hi>Davidis</hi> in <hi>Gen. q. 65.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:61577:4"/> The difficulty here is to make it out, that thoſe made up the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim were of the Tribe of Judah. It's not neceſſary that all ſhould be of it; if the major part were, that ſufficeth to preheminence the Tribe.</p>
            <p>At firſt the men of the Sanhedrim were choſen out of all the Tribes; but when ten Tribes fell off, it could not be, they being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and other King's who were againſt Judah; &amp; much leſſe could it be, when thoſe <hi>10.</hi> Tribes were carryed away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no more.

It was the diſorders, diviſions, ſcandalls, and corruptions, which ſet <hi>Paul</hi> on worke to write his two Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as you may obſerve throughout the Epiſtle. The doctrine of falſe teachers amongſt the <hi>Galatians,</hi> gave birth to that Epiſtle, Chap. 1.6. and in ſeverall parts of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle it clearely appeares. The danger of the <hi>Jewes</hi> forſaking their profeſſing of Chriſtianitie, and revolting to Moſaicall Ceremonies, open'd the doores for the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> to enter into the world.

The Papiſts hold faſt their images and idolatrous practiſes to this day, notwithſtanding all the judgements of God have been upon them. Acts of Authoritie may take downe Monuments of ſuperſtition, remove out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip, ceremonies, pictures, idolls; but can they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them out of mens hearts? its not the power of man, change of place, company, or duties will doe it, till the Lord ſpeake to the heart with a ſtrong hand, the idoll got in, will ſtand; mens affections and corruptions are very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of them.</p>

Hence ſaith the Lord in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an Oxe is as if he ſlew a man, and he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a doggs neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered ſwines bloud; he that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſs'd an idoll.</hi> What is the reaſon of this? why, <hi>They have choſen their own wayes, and their ſoule delighteth in their abomination;</hi> they have their idolls in their hearts, they are hypocrites, and come to mee, thinking to have favour of mee, and mercie from mee.

Repentance brings a man to his right wits, he becomes wiſe, and turnes from his folly and madneſſe: its cald a turning of men from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. Sin is darkneſſe, and when men ſin they know not what they doe; its the power of Satan holds them under his government; but repentance inlightens and ſets at libertie, ſo that men ſee and walke from under Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. Repentance and turning to God are put together, they are the ſame, but its not any turning, but a turning of the judgement, ſo that men judge otherwiſe of God, of his Lawes, wayes, of ſinne, of themſelves, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a turning of the will and affections, ſo that they are carried wholly and fully unto God. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Turne you unto mee, even with all your heart:</hi> if it be with a piece, its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, its hypocriticall, its deceitfull.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Repentance is a continued act; the word <hi>repent,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the continuation of it. Some have thought it one act, and that's ſufficient for a mans ſin, but repentance is a grace, and muſt have its daily operation as well as other graces; if faith, love, patience, humilitie, muſt continue, repentance muſt doe ſo likewiſe: where a ſpring breakes forth, its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes flowing: this is the ſpring of the ſoule, when God once ſmites the rockie heart, the water will flow: ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentants can no moee content themſelves with one act of repentance, then with one act of faith, they oft iterate and renew their repentance. Hence is it that the Lord would not have us forget our old ſinnes, but to thinke of them and mourne for them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Remember and forget not, how thou provokedſt the Lord thy God to wrath in the Wilderneſſe.</hi> Pſal. 25.7. <hi>Remember not the ſins of my youth, nor my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.9. <hi>I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, that am not meet to be cald an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> Ezek. 16.62, 63. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord, that thou mayeſt remember and be conſounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done.</hi>

                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. That when men leave God, and his wayes, then they fall to idolatrous and other ſinfull practiſes, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves from God, and ſet up idolls in their hearts: when once corruption hath taken off the heart from the Lord, who is an infinite good, then it cleaves to any creature, any dunghill god, and deifies that; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They went to Baalpeor, and ſeparated themſelves unto that ſhame:</hi> it was a ſhamefull idoll, yet having left God, they could imbrace it: and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>They have left off to take heed to the Lord; Whoredome, wine, and new wine, take away the heart; they aske counſell at their ſtocks, and their ſtaffe declareth unto them. Jer.</hi> 2.13. They forſooke God the fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, and then hewed themſelves Ciſterns that could hold no water. It was therefore good Counſell the Apoſtle gave, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evill heart of unbeliefe, in departing from the living God.</hi> Through unbeliefe men ſeparate from God, and that is the principle of all diſobedience, and lets the heart looſe unto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to every ſinne.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Men exceeding ſinfull may put on a face of holineſſe, theſe men who were idolaters, come to the Prophet, inquire of God by him, as if they were pious men, intended to know the minde of God, and doe what he would have done. This was counterfeit holineſſe, they had idolls in their hearts, and meant to keepe them there. <hi>Saul</hi> was ſometimes among the Prophets; The Devill ſeems an Angel of light, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vile men appeare Saints, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having a forme of godlineſſe.</hi> The worſt of men may make a cloake of Religion; Antichriſt ſits in the Temple, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, is baptized, and wonders at the miracles <hi>Philip</hi> wrought, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Looke what men are in coming unto God, the like ſhall they finde him unto them; they came to the Prophet fallaciouſly, and God would not anſwer them by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but by himſelfe; he knew how to deale with them, he knew their hearts, and ſo what was fitteſt to be ſaid or done unto them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.25, 26. <hi>With the mercifull thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe mercifull; with an upright man, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61577:16"/> upright; with the pure, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe pure; and with the froward, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe froward, or wreſtle with them:</hi> ſo <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.23, 24. <hi>If yee will walke contrary to wee, I will walke contrary to you.</hi> If a people come humbly unto God, and ſue for mercy, he will ſave them; but if their hearts ſwell, riſe within them, he <hi>will bring downe their high lookes, Pſal.</hi> 18.27. As God finds men, ſo he will proceed with them; ſo he dealt with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. God will proceed impartially with every man, be he Jew or Gentile, all is one to God; <hi>Every one of the houſe of Iſrael, or of the ſtranger that ſojourneth in Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> God neither accepts nor reſpects perſons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. If a Jew be guiltie, he ſhall have an anſwer ſuitable; ſo if a Gentile be faulty, his Gentiliſme ſhall not excuſe him.

                     <p n="5">5. Men ſet up idolls in their hearts, and God ſets his face againſt them, he becomes an adverſary unto them, looks ſeverely upon them, ſpeakes terribly unto them, and works powerfully againſt them. They had ſet their faces and hearts upon idolls for evill, and God ſets his face and heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for evill, and is reſolv'd to ruine them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.11. <hi>Behold, I will ſet my face againſt you for evill, and to cut off all Judah.</hi> To have God ſet his face againſt a people is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad.</p>
                     <p>There be ſeverall ſins mention'd in Scripture, for which God ſets his face againſt men, offering their ſeed to <hi>Molech, Levit.</hi> 20.2, 3. deſpiſing of his Statutes, and breaking his Covenant, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.15.17. idolatrie and hypocriſie here in the Text.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When Gods face is againſt a people, his judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them will be exemplary, he will make them ſignes and Proverbs in the world. <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.8. <hi>I will make this Citie deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and an hiſſing; every one that paſſeth thereby ſhall be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hiſſe, becauſe of all the plagues thereof.</hi> Chap. 18.16. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that paſſeth by, ſhall wagge his head at it.</hi> Chap. 42.18.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61577:17"/> 
                        <hi>Yee ſhall be an execration, and an aſtoniſhment, and a curſe, and a reproach.</hi> Mens names are deare unto them, but God will blaſt their names, make them to be <hi>a Taunt</hi> and <hi>Proverbe, Jer.</hi> 29.22. It was a Proverbe among them; <hi>The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the King of Babylon roſted in the fire.</hi> And when they wiſhed hurt to any, they uſed this ſpeech; <hi>God make them a reproach among all Nations,</hi> Ezek. 5.14, 15. And when this is done, God cuts them off from the land of the living in that condition.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The end of Gods ſetting his face againſt ſinners, and proceeding ſeverely with them, is, that they may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his juſtice and power over them.</p>

                     <p>There is no Creature ſo poyſonous, but God makes uſe of it to ſome good end; and there is no Prophet or Teacher ſo corrupt, no opinions ſo damnable or blaſphemous, but the Lord by his infinite power, orders and workes it to ſome good end. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>There muſt be Hereſies among you, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt among you.</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61577:22"/> God makes uſe of Hereſies, Sects and Sciſmes, to diſcover who are ſound, who not: when it is a time of warre, men of valour and Counſell are made knowne. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. When a falſe Prophet roſe up amongſt them, the Lord tells them it was to prove them, whither they did love the Lord, his Truthes, would hold them faſt and follow him; or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would be led aſide with erroneous doctrines, and follow ſeducing Teachers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

They are like Sheepe, and no creature apter to wander out of the right way, then that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.176. <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth he had gone aſtray like

                     <p n="4">4. Apteſt to leave the good pathes, and good Paſtures.

                     <p n="4">4. When Gods People are once gone aſtray, they would never returne of themſelves, if God ſhould let them alone in their wrong wayes; he muſt reduce them by his owne hand, and keepe them in the right way, by his owne power; a Sheepe wanders further and further, and thinks not of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning; <hi>David</hi> when he had left the way of God, turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> he goes further, he makes <hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61577:23"/> follow him, to walke with him, that they may no more goe aſtray from after me. To go after God, is to worſhip him in his owne way, to have him in our eye, to doe things in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, to follow his directions, commands, to obſerve his operations in the world, to leane upon him for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, comfort, aſſiſtance, ſafety and bleſſings, to ſubmit to his will, to receive what he reveales, following on to know God, and to get further communion with him. God would have his People to doe thus, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.10. <hi>They ſhall walke after the Lord.</hi> He would goe before them, and they ſhould follow him. They ſhould not goe after other gods, after their owne eyes, hearts, inventions, but after him. God commends <hi>David</hi> for his following him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.8. he ſets him there before <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and condemns him by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Thou haſt not been as my Servant David; who kept my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and who followed me with all his heart, to doe that only which was right in mine eyes.</hi> He went not from after God but followed him cloſly, and its very pleaſing to God when his People doe ſo. <hi>Elijah</hi> knew it well, and therefore ſaid to the People. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the Lord be God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him,</hi> doe not leave him to goe after any other.</p>
                     <p>God ſheweth mercy not only to little ſinners, but great ones, they were polluted with all their trangreſſions, with all their rebellious ſeditions: yet being the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his ſelect ones, he would pardon their ſins, though of an high nature; God is rich and great in mercy, and no ſinns can exceed his mercy, he would paſſe by their pollutions and tranſgreſſions, account them his People, and be their God, their ſins ſhould not obſtruct his grace. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Though their ſins be as red as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as ſnow, though they be red like as Crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.

                  <p>God often in Scripture cals <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Vine, and his Vinyard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.8.14, 15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.14, 27.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.6. <hi>And they were a noble Vine.</hi> Jer. 2.21. <hi>A choice Vine,</hi> Iſai. 5.2. <hi>A goodly Vine.</hi> Ezek. 17.8. but becauſe it was now become a degenerate plant of a ſtrange Vine. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>An emptie Vine.

                  <p>Wee ſhall a little ſhew you wherein the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were the Church of God, reſembled the Vine.</p>

                        <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. The Miniſters of God have warrant to uſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, ſimilitudes, in their teaching of the people, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth it here, he brings in a parable of the Vine-Tree,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61577:36"/> and allegorizeth upon it, and the Scripture is frequent in parables and allegories. Chriſt was much in parables; they help memory, if familiar and knowne, they convince more fully then plaine ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That men are apt to glory &amp; confide in the priviledges they have, <hi>What is the Vine-Tree more then any Tree?</hi> the Jewes becauſe they were Gods Vine, Gods people, thought themſelves better then any, then all other, that they ſhould never be cut downe and deſtroyd; what are not wee Gods Vine, his pleaſant plant? hath he not made a hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, done much for us? will he pluck up the hedge and lay us waſt? No man would ever deſtroy his owne Vine, and Vinyard, and ſhall we thinke God will deale ſo by his? The Jewes doted upon their priviledges, that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, they had the Temple, that they were a plant of Gods planting; and its incident to moſt, to adhere to, and confide in ſome priviledges they have; but whence had they, or any, their priviledges? if they were the people of God, his Vine, the Lord choſe them, they choſe not him, he planted them, and pleaſed to call them his Vine, and Vinyard, what ever excellencie or priviledge they had, it was from his free grace and good Pleaſure, neither they nor we can merit, or purchaſe ought at the hands of God; let us not glorie in priviledges, in carnall excellencies, have any confidence in the fleſh, but remember the more priviledges we have, the ſtronger obligation is upon us, to admire free grace, and to honour the God of our mercies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Lord knowes what all Trees are, the Vine-Tree in the Vineyard, and the Trees of the Forreſt, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> the Oakes of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and ſhrubs of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, he knowes the goodlineſſe or meanneſſe, the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or lowneſſe, the weakneſſe or ſtrength, the fruitfulneſſe or unfruitfulneſſe, the uſefulneſſe or unuſefulneſſe of every Tree: he knew what Trees the Jewes were, and what Trees the Gentiles were, which Tree was fit for the fire, and which fit for other ſervices; he knowes eve y mans nature, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, operations, uſes and ends.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Trees in the Forreſt and Wilderneſſe, may be of better

The Heathens that were Trees of the Forreſt, had more good in them, than the Jewes who were his Vine; they did more ſervice to the world, they were more juſt, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, faithfull, bountifull, pittifull than the Jewes, they were fitter for Temple-worke than the other: and is it not ſo now? are not many Forreſt-Trees better than us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</p>

When this Vine loſt its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it loſt the intereſt it had in the heart of God, and the more it degenerated, the more diſtaſtfull and reproachfull it became. Degeneracie from God and his wayes, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſinne, God had done more for his people, than any people in the world, he had given them ſuch a Land, ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Lawes, priviledges, as none elſe had; and now for them to forſake God, was a grievous treſpaſſe, they viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many bands of love, they brake the covenant of their God, and did ſecretly accuſe God, as not being ſo good as he had promiſed to be unto them, therefore <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.3. <hi>O my people what have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? teſtifie againſt me.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It offends God to have ſuch Trees in his Vineyard, People that bring forth nothing but wild grapes, curſed Fruit.

                     <p n="3">3. Fruitleſſeneſſe is a reproach to God, who is the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman of the Vineyard, as if he were not skilfull, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and did not what was fitting, to make the Vine to beare,<note place="margin">

The barren fig-tree muſt be cut downe, and why? it cumbers the ground, keeps out others which might be ſet up in the place, ſucks up the moyſture and fatnes of the earth, overſhaddows and prejudiceth the plants are neare.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Such are ſlighted, look'd upon as worthleſſe, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; take a Vine or Tree hath no fruit, its not regarded: its not the leaves or branches, but the fruit makes it eſteemed, its not a leavie profeſſion, but a fruitfull converſation makes people to be eſteemed. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.3. A woman beſtowes a box of precious oyntment upon Chriſts head, ſome envyed at it, but Chriſt ſaid ſhe had wrought a good worke, and this begate ſuch an high eſteeme of her, in the heart of Chriſt, that to honour her, he ſaid, the fact ſhould never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but where ever the Goſpell ſhould be preached in the world, that ſhe had done ſhould be ſpoken of, for a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of her, verſ. 9. ſhe was a Tree bare good fruit, and was honour'd for it, but fruitleſſe Trees are not minded, not valued; take a man that doth no good, we ſay he is an idle, an emptie man.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Fruitleſſeneſſe declares a man to be an evill man, a Tree is knowne by its fruit, if it have good fruit its a good Tree, if ill, its an ill Tree, but what if it have no fruit? you cannot ſay, its neither good nor bad, God hath no ſuch Trees, in his garden; in that it hath no fruit, its an ill Tree; a barren Tree cannot be good; when Chriſt found
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61577:39"/> no fruit upon the Tree, he dealt with it as with an evill Tree.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That is fruitleſſe, is neare to a curſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.19. when Chriſt ſaw a fig-tree without figs, what ſaid he to it? <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee hence forward for ever, and preſently the fig-Tree withered away, Heb.</hi> 6.8. <hi>The ground that brings forth bryars and thornes, not hearbs meet for the dreſſers, is rejected and nigh unto curſing,</hi> Prov. 10.7. <hi>The name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Wicked men are fruitleſſe, and God will curſe their names, <hi>Eſau, Jeroboam, Judas.</hi>

                     <p>If a Vine be fruitleſſe, God will take away what he hath beſtowed, and undoe what he hath done, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.5. <hi>I will tell you what I will doe to my Vineyard, I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up; and break downe the wall thereof, and it ſhall be trodden downe.</hi> The hedge and wall were Gods protection, and defence of them; now becauſe the Vine had no good fruit, was an empty Vine, the Lord would preſerve them no longer, but expoſe them to ſpoyle and ruine, God made a Law concerning fruitfull Trees, that they ſhould be preſerved <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.19. and God himſelfe is careful of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Trees and Vines that bring forth good grapes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65.8. <hi>As the new wine is found in the cluſter, &amp; one ſaith, deſtroy it not, for a bleſſing is in it, ſo will I doe for my Servants ſake.</hi> If Gods Trees, Vines be fruitfull, God will preſerve them, prohibit others to wrong them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15. <hi>Touch not mine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and doe my Prophets no harme.

Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted the People to obedience, upon this ground, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.9, <hi>Keepe the words of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and do them, that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> When men are obedient unto the Will of God, and ſo fruitful, it pleaſes the Lord to bleſſe them; the Jewes were the terrour of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whileſt they worſhiped God in his owne wayes, and executed juſtice in their Gates, 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 32.30. <hi>Hezekiah proſpered in all his workes,</hi> he abounded in doing good, and proſpered accordingly, if you bring forth ſweet grapes and pleaſant fruit, you ſhall proſper in your families, ſhops, jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, worſhip, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All Creatures are fruitfull one way or other, the earth is ſo plentifull in fruit bearing, that as it is the Mother of all living, ſo its the maintainer of them. What is there growes upon the face of the earth, which is altogether fruitleſſe, and doth not contribute ſomething to the good of man, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its Creator? Clouds are the bottles of heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carryed over the quarters of the earth, they emptie there ſilver drops to enrich the earth. The heavens yeild us their light and influence, and move conſtantly to doe us ſervice; that old Servant of the world the Sunne, is not yet wearie of ſending downe her beames to warme us, and all other creatures: hath God made the heavens and earth uſefull and fruitfull for man, and all the fiſh, fowle, beaſts, birds, plants in them? and ſhall man be barren? it was a reproach for a woman in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be ſo, and ſurely for a Chriſtian it is a great reproach to be ſo.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Its the appointment of the Lord Chriſt, that thoſe are his ſhould be fruitfull, <hi>John</hi> 15.16. <hi>I have choſen you and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained you, that you ſhould goe and bring forth fruit:</hi> that they ſhould preach, pray, convert ſoules, worke miracles, plant

                     <p n="6">6. Its an honour to God to be fruitfull; when a Vine is full of goodly cluſters, what a credit, what a chearing is it to the Vinedreſſer? when the ground yeilds great increaſe, its an honour to the Husbandman; when Trees are loaden with fruit, the Gardiner glories in it, come looke upon this Tree; when the Ewes beare Twins, its the Shepheards honour: and ſo when Chriſtians are fruitfull, its the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye heare much fruit.</hi> When Chriſtians are fruitfull, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes others, to praiſe the name of the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>

The Lord ſhewes mercie to men when they are in deſperate conditions; when this Infant was caſt out, loathd, lay polluted in her blood (for her Navell was not cut, nor heal'd, but ſhe lay bleeding to death) ready to be devoured by the beaſts of the Feild, the fowles of Heaven, &amp;c. then God ſaid, live.

When in <hi>Babylon,</hi> all their necks were upon the block, by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> plot and power, the Lord ſhew'd them mercie, and ſaid, live: ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons den, the three Children in the fierie furnace, &amp;c. God preſerved them, freed them from their dangers, enemies; and caus'd them to live. Take life for ſpirituall life, and you ſhal find that the Lord hath ſaid live, when men have been in deſperate caſes, and at the brinke of eternall deſtruction. The Thiefe upon the Croſſe met vvith life in the gates of death, and ſo the <hi>Jaylour</hi> Act. 16. One ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fiſh-bone ſticking in his throat, and ready to be ſtrangled, being reproved for ſwearing and curſing, at that time, was ſo wrought upon, that the life of ſin, was turn'd into the life of grace. Another being in a wood, and going to hang himſelfe, the Lord in his providence, caus'd one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the wood, to heare a noiſe, who came in, counſel'd the man, ſo as that he was wrought upon at that time, and liv'd.

The <hi>Samaritane,</hi> as he paſſed by the man wounded, tooke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bind up his wounds, and ſave his life. Chriſt in the 9. of <hi>John</hi> going by ſaw a blind man, and thereupon annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his eyes, and cauſed him to ſee: ſo in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.14. you read of leaving a bleſſing behind him; God paſſes through Kingdomes, Families, and uſes to leave bleſſings where he goes, he takes occaſion from what he ſees, and finds, to diſtribute mercies: Chriſt when he was going out of the world, ſaid, <hi>Peace I leave with you, John</hi> 14.27. he would not leave them without a bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſhould labour to be like unto God and Chriſt, take occaſions and advantages to doe good.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In beſtowing mercies God is ſerious and reall; this appeares from the ingemination of the words, <hi>live, live;</hi> when there is a doubling of the ſame word, there the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, realitie, and earneſtneſſe of the Author ſpeaking is held out; be it in matter of judgement, or matter of mercie. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.8. <hi>I, even I, am againſt thee;</hi> God was ſeriouſly,

                     <p>In what this nakedneſſe laye, is needful a little to inquire.

                     <p>Its probable their povertie was great in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were to goe out of it, they borrowed Raiment of the Aegiptians, and Jewells of gold and ſilver, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.35.

                     <p>Now what this ſpreading of the wing or skirt meanes, fals into conſideration.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemes to import a marriage rite. When they were to be eſpouſed or marryed among the Jewes, it was a cuſtom to ſpread their garment over them; Hence it was that <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Boas, Ruth</hi> 3.9. <hi>Spread thy skirt over thy hand-Maid, for thou art a neere Kinſman,</hi> that is, betroth thee unto me, and marrie me; The Law vvas that when a man dyed without iſſue, ſome neare Kinſman ſhould marry the Widdow, injoy the Inheritance, and raiſe up Seed to him was dead, and the Ceremonie uſed, was ſpreading the skirt over them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.30. a man muſt not diſcover his Fathers skirt; that is, he muſt not have to doe with his Step-Mother, whom his Father hath ſpread his skirt over, and marryed, defiling of her is uncovering of his Fathers skirt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.20. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> ſaith, it was a rite of marriage, or certainly a promiſe of marriage, if a man did cover a woman with his skirt or garment.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, this rite implies protection, defence, ſafetie; the wing of any Fowle, ſpread over its young, is a ſafetie unto it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 31.5. <hi>As Birds flying, ſo will the Lord of Hoſts defend Jeruſalem:</hi> when Birds ſee their young in danger, they flye, make haſt unto them, ſpread their wings over them, and ſo defend them: in like manner would the Lord doe, ſpread
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61577:66"/> his wing of protection over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and preſerve it; hence that phraſe in Scripture, of truſting in the ſhaddow and covert of his wings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7:57.1:61.4:63.7:91.4. but this protection we ſpeake of, is not protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall, but <hi>Maritalis protectio,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> was to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Gen.</hi> 20.16. <hi>A covering of the eyes,</hi> God was a covering to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>

                        <hi>Calvin</hi> thinkes that by this ſpreading of their skirt, is meant all that power, and goodneſſe of God which he put forth in delivering of them out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> the Lord brought them out with a ſtrong hand, and ſtretched out arme, his power, mercie, wiſedome, goodneſſe appeared marvailouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that worke; he tels them, <hi>Exod</hi> 19.4. what he had done for them, <hi>Yee have ſeene what I have done unto the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> (I hav ſent plague after plague upon them, till I had utterly conſum'd them, and in the midſt of al, you were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) <hi>And how I bare you upon Eagles wings, and brought you unto my ſelfe.</hi>

                     <p>God promiſed that at the end of 70. yeares, they ſhould returne from <hi>Babylon;</hi> when that time was out, then was the time of love, God fulfil'd his promiſe and brought them to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againe, which <hi>Iſai.</hi> chap. 54.7. cals <hi>A gathering with great mercies.</hi>

                     <p>Now if <hi>Moſes</hi> was under a Covenant of grace before, God would not reduce him back to a Covenant of workes.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Gods bringing them to a gladſome condition after their ſoare bondage in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and 40 yeares travel in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.

                     <p n="3">3. Gods teaching of them in the wayes of his worſhip, never before had any people ſuch Lawes, rules given them for divine worſhip, for regulation of their lives and wayes, towards God and man as they had, now teaching is ſet out by Oyle and Unction, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20.27. <hi>Ye have an unction, and the annointing teacheth you all things;</hi> that was the Spirit: God annointed <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets which were amongſt this people with the Spirit, and ſo taught them all things needfull for their condition, what ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 4.5. <hi>I have taught you Statutes and judgements, even as the Lord my God commanded me: Moſes</hi> and the Prophets ſpake as the holy Spirit moved them, and having the ſpirit of propheſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, they may be ſaid to be annointed.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe whoſe ſinnes God forgives, he fully forgives, <hi>I throughly waſh'd away thy bloods,</hi> I ſuffered no ſinne, no guilt to ſtick upon thee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle cleane water upon you, and ye ſhall be cleane from all your filthineſſe, and from all your Idols I will cleanſe you:</hi> ſprinkling of them with cleane water imports the ſprinkling of them with the blood of Chriſt, whereby ſinnes are purged and done away, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth</hi> from all ſinne, not ſome few, ſome little, ſome great, ſome old, ſome new ſinnes, but from all ſin; when God pardons he pardons throughly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity whereby they have ſinned againſt mee, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned againſt mee.</hi> Let the ſins, iniquities, be what they will, when the Lord is upon the worke of forgiving, he will forgive them all: <hi>David</hi> bleſſeth God upon this ground, becauſe <hi>God was a God forgiving all iniquities, Pſal.</hi> 103.3. that place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. is to our purpoſe. <hi>He will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon,</hi> not ten, twenty, a hundred, or a thouſand ſins, but ten thouſand ſins, all wicked wayes, all evill thoughts.

                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:61577:80"/> It's his will, his nature to be mercyfull, nothing pleaſes him more, then to ſhew mercy. The Hebrew is, <hi>He will multiply to pardon,</hi> if man have multlplied ſins, he will multiply meanes to pardon thoſe ſins; the ſins of the Creature ſhall not be ſupernumerary to the mercies of the Creator. Man is a Father of ſins, and God is a Father of mercies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. Doth man beget and bring forth thouſands of ſins in a day?

                     <p>Sodome was ſeated in a moſt fertile place, in the Plain of Jordane which was well watered every where, even as the Garden of the Lord, like the land of Aegypt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10.

You may demand whether a plentifull eſtate in corne, cattle,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61577:142"/> oyle, wine, fowle, fiſh, fruit, &amp;c. be ſinfull, becauſe fulneſſe of bread, which imports theſe things, is reckoned up among <hi>Sodoms</hi> iniquities. The anſwer is, that plentifulneſſe of ſuch things is not evill, but a great bleſſing, and men thereby have occaſion to doe much good. The ſinne lyeth not in having of much meate and drinke, but in their exceſſive eating and drinking; they were intemperate, feeding and drinking ſo fully, that inſtead of ſatisfying, they ſurfeited nature: and here by fulneſſe of bread is meant both glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and drunkenneſſe; of both which, ſomething is to be ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Gluttony may ſeeme to bee no ſinne upon a double ground.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth the man:</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that goeth into the belly, and is caſt out into the draught,</hi> verſ. 17. That is a ſinne doth defile, but nothing eaten doth ſo. It's true, that the meate eaten in its owne nature doth not defile; the meats forbidden to the Jewes, if any did eate of them at any time, the defilement lay not ſimply in the meate, but in the breach of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>viz.</hi> eating forbidden meat; for if any meate did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, <hi>ratione ſui</hi> of its owne ſubſtance and nature, it were never lawfull to eate that meate; but ſo doth no meate, it's therefore not the meate, but the inordinate deſire of meate which makes the ſinne, and cauſeth the defilement.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In whatſoever is ſinfull, the firſt motion thereunto is ſo; the firſt motion to anger, to idolatry, to uncleanneſſe is ſo: but now the principle or firſt motion to eating is hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and its moſt certain that is not ſinful; for then the more hungry any ſhould be, the greater ſinner he is.</p>
                     <p>For clearing this doubt you muſt know there is a double deſire of meate: one naturall, ſimply tending to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the creature, and ſubſervient to the vegetative power of the ſoule: and this riſes not from any apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this or that in the meate, but <hi>a naturae indigentia,</hi> only from want in nature: and this is truly cal'd hunger, and ſo farre from being ſinful, that the greater it is, the more it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth liberall eating.</p>

                        <pb n="277" facs="tcp:61577:142"/>2. There is another deſire of meat which is ſenſitive, and tendeth to the pleaſing of the ſenſuall part in man, and fals under the power of reaſon; which the other did not, being meerly naturall: and here the firſt motion or deſire of meate beyond what ſound reaſon approves, is inordinate in the ſenſitive appetite, and ſo ſinfull.</p>
                     <p>Gluttony, the nature of it lyes in an inordinate deſire of eating, and men are ſaid to gluttonize ſeverall wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When they deſire delicacies, not being content with thoſe meates providence hath given in. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4.

                     <p n="2">2. When they are too ſolicitous about the cooking and dreſſing of their meates, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.15. The Prieſts ſervant came &amp; ſaid to the man that ſacrificed, <hi>Give fleſh to roaſt for the Prieſt, for he will not have ſodden fleſh of thee, but raw.</hi> Why would he have raw fleſh? that he might prepare and cooke it more curiouſly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. When men are greedy of meate, not obſerving ſuch a decorum as becomes men; dogges, hawks, ſwine are greedy and haſty of their meat, &amp; ravenous in eating. The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay this was <hi>Eſau's</hi> ſinne, who ſlighting his birth-right, ſold it for pottage, and <hi>nimis avide ſumpſit cibum,</hi> greedily devoured them.</p>

                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:61577:143"/>5. When men eate too much, exceeding in the quantity, and this is moſt properly gluttony: and this was <hi>Sodomes</hi> ſinne, <hi>fulneſſe of bread</hi> and drink, now too much is eaten and drunken.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. When made heavy and dull, ſo that the operations of body and mind are hindered thereby, and men unfitted for the duties of their callings in publique or private. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.21. ſpeaking of the drunkard and glutton, hee preſently mentions drowſineſſe; becauſe too much eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes drowſie and unfits for all action.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall ſhew you what an evill, unmercifulneſſe is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It's an argument and evidence of covetouſneſſe; when Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. bids them make to themſelves friends of the mammon of unrighteouſneſſe (which he ſo cals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men uſually ſin in the getting, keeping, or uſing of them) and ſaid, they could not ſerve God and Mammon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> who were covetous, derided him; they thought Chriſt ſpake like an ignorant man; they could ſerve God, keepe their wealth, and not caſt it away upon poore people, This ſhewed their covetouſneſſe: and what an evil that is, let <hi>Paul</hi> tell you. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>The love of money is the root of all evill;</hi> inward and outward evils doe ſpring from it. A covetous man is <hi>an idolater,</hi> Eph. 5.5. he hath <hi>no inheritance in the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.10. he is abhor'd of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſaith, he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwel with a thouſand poſſeſt, then with one covetous
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61577:153"/> man; for they hurt their garments and themſelves, but a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man hurts his neighbours. <hi>Chryſ. Math.</hi> 10. as cited by <hi>Stella</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's argument of unbeliefe: men think if they give to the poor, and ſtrengthen the hands of the needy; that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall want and come to poverty. Prov. 28.27. <hi>Hee that giveth unto the poore ſhall never lacke.</hi> Here is the voyce of God, who is truth it ſelfe, and hath power enough to make good what he hath ſaid, for the earth and fulneſſe of it is his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. And yet mans heart diſtruſts God, and thinks of other wayes to provide for it ſelfe: I will keepe what I have; if this be gone I know not what I ſhall have; it's a hard world, and one bird in the hand is worth two in the buſh. Thus unbeliefe diſcovers it ſelfe, and had rather truſt in uncertaine riches, then in the al-ſufficient and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God: ſaith God, <hi>give to the poore and thou ſhalt not lacke:</hi> ſaith the hard-hearted man, <hi>give to the poore, and thou ſhalt lacke.</hi> Thus doth he croſſe the will of God, and put the lie upon him. Eccleſ. 11.1. <hi>Caſt thy bread upon the waters, for thou ſhalt find it after many dayes:</hi> No ſaith the unmercifull man, <hi>I will never caſt my bread upon them, for I ſhall never ſee it againe.</hi> And ſo makes God a lyar, and declares himſelfe an unbeliever.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's argument there is no love of God in that man; it's a ſadde charge to tell any man he doth not love God. <hi>John</hi> is peremptory in it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>Who ſo hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> he may think he loves God, and others may think and ſay ſo, but there is not any dram of Gods love in that man, how dwels it in him? this Interrogation imports a ful negation; for if a man lov'd God, hee would love man who is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God. Chriſts command is, <hi>that we love one another as he hath loved us,</hi> John 15.12. He teſtified his love, by giving his blood, his fleſh, his life: and we will not give a little bread, an old garment, a little ſilver, it's a cleare demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration there is no love of God in us.</p>
                     <p>The primitive Chriſtians were diſtinguiſhed from others
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61577:153"/> by their love, and that made them ſell all, bring it and lay it down at the Apoſtles feet for the reliefe of the poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.34, 35.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It's a ſin hath much cruelty and unnaturalneſſe in it. Iſa. 58.7. <hi>Deale thy bread to the hungry, cover the naked, and hide not thy ſelfe from thine owne fleſh;</hi> the poore are our owne fleſh. Mal. 2.10. <hi>Have we not all one father?</hi> hath not one God created us? Prov. 22.2. <hi>The rich and the poore meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Lord is the maker of them all.</hi> Hence hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>that we ſhould love our neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> Matth. 22.39. Now if we hide away our eyes from them, if wee will not conſider their neceſſities, wants, and relieve them, we are cruel and unnaturall: if a man be naked or hungry, a man wil ſeek to cloath and feed himſelfe, he wil not hate his owne fleſh. Epheſ. 5.29. <hi>No man ever yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it.</hi> When men therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſtrengthen the hands of the poore and needy, they deſpiſe, they hate their own fleſh, they are unnaturall: and to prevent this, God hath laid a command to be mercifull, where the ſtrongeſt reaſon and plea might be againſt it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. <hi>If thine enemie be hungry, give him bread to eate: and if hee be thirſty, give him water to drinke.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. It makes men altogether unlike God; <hi>he is the father of mercies, and God of all comfort,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. <hi>He makes his ſunne to riſe on the evill and on the good, and ſendeth raine on the juſt and unjuſt,</hi> Matth. 5.45. <hi>He giveth food to all fleſh,</hi> Pſal. 136.25. <hi>He heares the deſires of the humble and poore,</hi> Pſal. 10.17. <hi>He is kind to the unthankefull and to the evill, be yee therefore merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as your father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6.36.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61577:154"/> and turne away his owne heart. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.38. <hi>With the ſame meaſure that yee meet withall, ſhall it be meaſured to you againe:</hi> you ſtop your eares, God will ſtop his eare: you ſhut up your bowels.

Suppoſe a man in the water or fire, you paſſe by, and lend him not your
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61577:155"/> hand, which if you had done, his life had been ſav'd, are not you now guilty of his death? When the Prieſt and Levite paſſed by the man that going from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho</hi> fel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Thieves, and relieved him not, it was their ſin; and had he dyed in that condtion, they had been acceſſaries to his death. If the poor be our fleſh, then our goods are theirs as wel as ours: and if we let them periſh, we murther them and our ſelves too.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The end of that man wil be very ſad who hath beene mercileſſe to others, he muſt have the end of a fruitleſſe, or dead tree, he muſt be hewn downe and caſt into the fire. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He ſhall have judgement without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy:</hi> all judgement, meere ſeverity, pure wrath ſhal be his portion. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, 42, &amp;c. it's the chiefe, if not the only ſin which Chriſt mentions at the day of judgement. <hi>I was hungry, and ye gave me no meate, I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drinke:</hi> You ſhewed me in my poore members no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>therefore depart from me yee curſed into everlaſting fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devill and his Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing then uncharitableneſs is ſo great an evil, let us put on bowels of mercy, and ſtrengthen the hands of the poore and needy. It's a hard time, things are dear, trading little, poore abound, and therefore now its ſeaſonable for the rich to open the bowels of their compaſſion, and to ſuccour thoſe that are in want. <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>a father to the poore,</hi> Chap. 29.16. he <hi>did not eat his morſels alone,</hi> the fatherleſſe eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.17. The bellies and loynes of the poor bleſſed him, being fil'd and warm'd with the fleſh and fleece of his ſheep, <hi>v.</hi> 20 <hi>Dorcas, Acts</hi> 9 39. It were wel if <hi>Jobs</hi> and <hi>Dorcas</hi> ſpirit &amp; compaſſions were in al rich men, that ſo the hungry might be fed, the naked cloath'd, and neceſſities of the poore ſupplyed: ſpare ſomething out of your ſuperfluities for them. Can you adorn your houſes with pictures and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? your tables with Carpets, your ſhelves with Pewter and Braſſe, your Cloſets and Cupboards with Plate, and have you nothing for the poor who are the temples of God? Can you feed your dogs, parrets, monkeyes, pamper your
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61577:155"/> horſes, and not mind poore Chriſtians which lye at your doors? If it be ſo, how will the Lord take it at your hands? Remember <hi>Dives,</hi> he had been better to have given all to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zurus,</hi> then to have met with ſuch an end for his unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. The Lord Chriſt hath told you it's a bleſſed thing to give, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35. You would count it a bleſſed thing to ſhew kindneſſe to Chriſt; the pappes that gave Chriſt ſucke were counted bleſſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.27. When you give to the poore, you give to Chriſt: <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40. <hi>In aſmuch as you have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, you have done it unto me.</hi> The are Chriſts brethren thou doſt it unto, and he accounts it done to himſelfe, yea the leaſt or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt it's done unto.</p>
                     <p>Again, is it not a bleſſed thing to have the Lord of heaven and earth to be indebted to one. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Hee that hath pitty on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him againe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. God is the poor mans ſurety.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He takes the debt upon himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Gives thee his word for ſecurity; his faithfulneſſe and his honour are engag'd for performance: had you the Cities bond, the Parliaments ſecurity, the publique faith for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiment of what you expend upon the poore, it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this: O give, give unto the poor, and make God as much as you can indebted to you, hee is a good payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.38. <hi>Give and it ſhall be given unto you,</hi> good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, preſſed downe, ſhaken together, and running over. If you will not make God your debter by giving, he will be your Judge for not giving.</p>
                     <p>We live in dangerous times, and riches are uncertaine things; the way to make them ſafe, is to beſtow them upon the poor. Eccleſ. 11.1. <hi>Caſt thy bread upon the waters, for thou ſhalt find it after many dayes:</hi> If you keep it, you loſe; if you caſt it away, you ſhall find it again.</p>
                     <p>One had this Epitaph upon his tomb:
<q>Habeo quod dedi perdidi quod ſervavi:</q>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Seeing wee are to ſtrengthen the hands of the poore and needy, whether are we to give to all in ſuch caſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's the judgment of ſome, that no beggars ſhould be reliev'd that goe from doore to doore, they think it an unwarrantable practiſe for people to doe ſo, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd upon ſo doing, its the nurſery of many vagabonds, and vile perſons; ſuch live in no calling, are under no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are the ſhame of the Magiſtrate, a diſorder in a Common-wealth, and reproach of the lawes are made for reliefe of the poore in their ſeverall reſpective places. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe that begge up and downe, being able to work, and will not, you ought not to relieve, you ſin in doing of it; the Apoſtles rule is, <hi>if any will not worke he muſt not eat,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. And further, when Begging is made a trade, I ſee not how it's juſtifiable before God, or can be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by man; there are few but can do ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their living; and if they cannot, they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved otherwiſe then by begging.</p>
                     <p>Yet to conclude it unlawfull to give to any that begge, I dare not: Chriſt healed two blind beggars, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.35.42. <hi>John</hi> 9.7, 8. and did not reprove them for their begging.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, he hath given out a rule, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.30. <hi>Give to every man that asketh of thee,</hi> which would be void and uſeleſſe if I might give to no beggars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Then, if you be able, you ought to give to all that are truly poor and needy, juſtly neceſſitated to aske, even thoſe that are able to worke, and willingly would work; but through the ill diſpoſition of the times cannot get any, or not ſufficient to maintain them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If men be not able to relieve all that ſhall aske, then

                        <pb n="320" facs="tcp:61577:164"/>1. That as God would have wholly ſpared <hi>Sodom</hi> had there been ten righteous in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.32. So there being many righteous in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who cryed for mercy, and bewailed the abominations thereof, the Lord leſſened the judgment. That there were many righteous in it, who ſighed and cryed to the Lord, you may ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.6. And if God will divert judgements for their ſakes, hee may alſo leſſen them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Gods judgements upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> all laid together, were greater then the fiery hand of God upon <hi>Sodome:</hi> the Famine, which made the pittiful women to eate their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.10. The fathers to eate their ſonnes, and the ſons their fathers openly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.10. The Peſtilence, the Sword, and Captivity were, all things conſidered, ſoarer ſtroaks of God upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then the fire from Heaven upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> and you have divine teſtimony for it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The puniſhment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people, is greater then the puniſhment of the ſinne of Sodome that was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown in a moment, and no hand ſtayed on her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sodoms puniſhment was ſharp, but ſhort: <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> was ſharp and long; to kill a man by degrees, by cutting off fingers, toes, eares, armes, legs, is farre worſe then cuting off the head at once; ſuch was Gods dealings with <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                     <p>I anſw. God hath his prerogative to puniſh ſinners with what degree of puniſhment he pleaſe here in this life; hee may puniſh leſſer ſinners with greater puniſhments, and greater ſinners with leſſer puniſhments, &amp; yet be free from partiality or injuſtice, becauſe he hath a day to reckon with ſinners hereafter, and then wil render to them fully accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merit of their ſinnes. Ezra 9.13. <hi>God puniſhed them leſſe then their iniquities deſerved.</hi> And if <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment came ſhort of the ten Tribes, the more remain'd behind without repentance, &amp; God rendered it in due time;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61577:164"/> but upon ſearch into the word, it may appeare that <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems</hi> puniſhment was not ſhort, but beyond the tenne Tribes. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.9, 10, 11, 12. God ſaith there, <hi>he will doe that in her which he had not done, &amp; whereunto he would not do any more the like.</hi> The meaning is, he would puniſh <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> more, and otherwiſe then he had done <hi>Sodome, Samaria,</hi> or any other before. God ſweares there, that hee would <hi>not ſpare them, nor have any pitty. Samaria</hi> was not burnt, when taken, and the Tribes carryed away; but <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and all the holy things in it were burnt, and taken away, the people divided into 3 thirds, and each third pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with judgement.</p>

Tribes were gone into captivity before <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> dayes; about the ſixth yeare of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> they were caryed away, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied not till the 13th year of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> Jer. 1.2. and he was then come to the dayes and reign of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> as appears, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.1.

Neither of them were little ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or had any righteouſneſſe; but being laid together, ſins and ſinners, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was tranſcendently ſinfull, and unrighteous, and they leſſe ſinfull, leſſe unrighteous. Great things when they are exceeded by greater in view, they ſeem little: a great houſe is nothing to a great rocke, a great mountain or Citie; a great River is nothing to the Ocean, ſo a great heape of ſins is as nothing to a greater; what's a cart-full of dung to a great dunghill, and as it is in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, ſo in qualities: ſome poyſons are ſo poyſonous, ſo ſtrong, that they kill immediately, others, though more in quantity, yet are longer in producing ſuch an effect, and in compariſon they are no poyſons: ſo ſome ſins and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners compared with others, are as none. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. <hi>The Publican went down to his houſe juſtified rather then the Phariſee:</hi> This Phariſee compar'd himſelfe with the Publican, and thought himſelfe righteous; but the Publican in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him was righteous.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61577:168"/> not minatory, affirming that the Lord here promiſeth to ſhew mercy to the captives of <hi>Sodome, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to bring them all back againe. But becauſe <hi>Sodome</hi> and her daughters were utterly deſtroyed, and they ſaw not how they could be return'd; therefore they labour much to prove, that by <hi>Sodome</hi> is meant the two Tribes and halfe on the other ſide <hi>Jordan; Reuben, Gad,</hi> and halfe <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> but theſe are comprehended in <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was the head City of the ten Tribes: and if that ſhould be yielded, the difference between <hi>Sodome</hi> and her daughters, and <hi>Samaria</hi> and her daughters would be great, yet taken away.</p>
                     <p>Others therefore by Sodome here underſtand the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> that came from the loyns of <hi>Lot,</hi> who dwelt in Sodome, as appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.37, 38.</p>
                     <p>But the Scripture gives no warrant to account theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> rather they ſhould have been cald <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,</hi> or <hi>Lottites,</hi> ſeeing they deſcended from his loyns.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the word Sodome is to be taken in it's proper and native ſenſe here as well as <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that Sodome to be meant, of which he ſpake in the 49. &amp; 50. <hi>verſ.</hi> which was deſtroyed with her daughters by fire from heaven, and ſo deſtroyed that no man can or ſhall dwell or abide there, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.18.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if the words doe hold out a promiſe of mercy, it's firſt to <hi>Sodome</hi> and her daughters; next to <hi>Samaria</hi> and hers; and laſt to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and her daughters: ſo that they muſt be reſtor'd to their former eſtate before <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but neither Sodome nor Samaria were reſtored before the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ended in Babylon. It's cleare enough that the words are not a promiſe of mercy, but a threatning of ſeverity, and it lyes thus: <hi>When I ſhall bring again the captivity of Sodome and Samaria, which I will never doe, then will I bring againe thy captivity.</hi> I have deſtroyed them utterly, and intend not to replant them, but to let them lye in the dark, and abide in captivity, and thy condition ſhall be like unto theirs.</p>
                     <p>Some read the words with an interrogation, thus; <hi>Shall
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61577:169"/> I bring againe their captivity? the captivity of Sodome and her daughters? the captivity of Samaria and her daughters? and ſhall I bring againe the captives?</hi> No, I will neither doe the one nor the other; thou haſt ſin'd above them, and haſt no cauſe but to expect more rigorous dealings from mee then they have had. <hi>Piſc. Junius, Polan.</hi> read the words conditionally thus; <hi>If I ſhall returne the captivity of Sodome and Samaria, then I will returne thine:</hi> but it's not in my thoughts, counſels, or purpoſes, to return and reſtore them, who never provoked me as thou haſt done; therefore much leſſe do I intend to do ſo by thee.</p>
                     <p>Some take the words ironically: <hi>when I reſtore Sodome and Samaria, then will I reſtore thee.</hi> But they are ſo deſtroy'd that they are paſt recovery; I intend never to bring the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites out or the fire and ſeate them in <hi>Sodome;</hi> nor the ten Tribes out or captivity, and ſettle them in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and no more doe I meane to reſtore thee and thy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Did not the Lord return the captivity of Jeruſalem af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 70. <hi>yeares? how is it then true which is ſaid here if this be the ſence?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When God threatens them with utter deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it's to be meant of the body of people in generall who had apoſtatized from God as the ten Tribes had done, and there was no hope left for them; they were deſtroyed the moſt of them in the war, famine, plague, captivity: and ſo not they, but ſome of their poſterity were reſtored, and brought back againe. God had promiſed the Jewes came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that they ſhould enter into Canaan: but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.

                     <p>The ſins of people may come to ſuch an height, admit of ſuch dreadfull aggravations, as to cauſe God to cut off all hopes of mercy, and caſt them into irrecoverable miſery; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had ſo ſin'd here, provoked God ſo heinouſly, that he ſaith he would ſooner bring backe the captivity of Sodome and Samaria, then hers; they were cut off and caſt into ſuch conditions as were irrecoverable, for leſſer ſinnes, and therefore what could ſhee looke for, God would not ſhew her any pity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.11.7.4. read <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1, 2.3, 4, 5, 6. where you ſhall find God was ſo provoked by the ſins of this people, that though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould plead for them, his mind could not be towards them; hee would caſt them out of his ſight, and death, ſword, famine, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſhould devour them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.25, 26. <hi>I am againſt thee O deſtroying mountaine,</hi> I <hi>will ſtretch out my hand upon thee, and roll thee downe from the rockes, and will make thee a burnt mountaine. And they ſhall not take of thee a ſtone for a corner, nor a ſtone for foundations, but thou ſhalt be deſolate for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's ſpoken of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe ſins had gotten up to ſuch an height, that the Lord threatned her with irrecoverable ruine; he would deale with this Babyloniſh ſtate as with a thing burnt to aſhes, which is unſerviceable, irrecoverable; he would ſo break the power and ſtate of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that it ſhould never recover it ſelfe more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. One great end of Gods denying hope of mercy, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61577:170"/> caſting into irrecoverable miſery, is to bring ſinners to ſhame and confuſion: God ſaith he will never returne her captivity, that ſhe might beare her own ſhame, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in all ſhe had done. You have diſgraced the holy Temple with your Idols; the holy Citie and Land with your violence and bloody crimes; my holy name with your inventions and abominations; therefore when once I have ſent you into captivity, you ſhall not return thence at all, but live in diſgrace, periſh in what you have done, your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is hopeleſſe and helpleſſe; you have made me to beare ſhame, but in your captivity you ſhall beare ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach enough, even to confuſion. Jer. 22.22. <hi>Thy lovers ſhall goe into captivity, ſurely then ſhall thou be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for all thy wickedneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Great ſinners and great ſufferers afford comfort, ſuch as it is, to other ſinners and ſufferers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a greater ſinner, and all things conſidered, a greater ſufferer then <hi>Sodome</hi> or <hi>Samaria:</hi> and it's here ſaid, <hi>in that thou art a comfort unto them.</hi> Her ſins juſtified their ſins, her ſufferings juſtified their ſufferings: When Cities, Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, or Perſons doe ſee others to exceed them in ſins or puniſhments, they conceive theirs are the leſſe, and ſo frame a kind of comfort. <hi>Conſolatio miſerorum eſt habere ſocios pares aut tranſcendentes.</hi> Thoſe are miſerable, through ſin or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do think it ſome reliefe to have companions, equals, or thoſe goe beyond them, eſpecially in the ſame kind. Mar. 6.11. <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodome and Gomorrha in the day of judgement then for that Citie.</hi> This will be a comfort when that day comes, that any have been worſe then they in ſinning, and ſuffer more grievouſly for their ſins When the <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> ſaw thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> brought into the ſame condition with themſelves, to be captives, it eaſed their hearts. When men ſuffer alone, it ſtings. In a ſtorme at Sea, if one man be ſhip-wrack'd that afflicts more deeply; but if there be fellowes, and thoſe ſuffering more hard things, it eaſes in ſome meaſure.</p>
                     <p>It will be an eaſe to thouſands at the laſt day, when they
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61577:171"/> ſhall ſee the children of the Kingdome caſt out into utter darkeneſſe, that their ſinnes and puniſhments exceeded theirs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Gods bleſſings, and abundance of creature-comforts, through the corruption that is in man, ſwels them with pride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had variety of mercies, peace and plenty, and ſhe was puffed up. <hi>In the day of thy pride.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Proſperity makes proud, and fils with windy conceits of happineſſe, and continuance in that happineſſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong Citie, and as an high wall in his owne conceite.</hi> He thinks himſelfe fenced and guarded ſo ſtrongly, that he is ſecure, and deſpiſes dangers. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.5. Speaking of the Prince of Tyrus, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>By thy great wiſdome and thy traffique haſt thou encreaſed thy rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and thy heart is lifted up becauſe of thy riches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's a hard matter for men of high eſtates, not to have high minds; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> counſels <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>charge thoſe that be rich in this world, that they be not high-minded,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. I have lately ſpoken of this ſubject; it was <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſin, <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſin, and I ſhall not inſiſt upon it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Proud perſons mind not Gods dealings with others, though like themſelves. Sodoms ſinne was pride, haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and for theſe ſins ſhe and her daughters were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fire from heaven; but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in her pride forgets Sodome, and never once names her; <hi>thy ſiſter Sodome was not mentioned by thy mouth.</hi> She ſhould have conſidered Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt Sodome for her ſins, and ſeene to it that they had not been found in her ſelf: but plenty bred pride, pride blinded, and made her forgetfull of that example of divine vengeance. It was near unto them; the place where Sodome ſtood was a ſulphurious lake, a lively monument of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens diſpleaſure againſt pride &amp; other ſins: <hi>Lots</hi> wife turn'd into a pillar of ſalt to ſeaſon them with fear, yet they took no notice of theſe things, Iſa. 5.12. <hi>They regarded not the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61577:171"/> worke of the Lord, neither conſidered the operation of his hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Lord expects that we ſhould take notice of, and improve his judgments upon others: he blames <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here for not minding <hi>Sodomes</hi> condition; <hi>thy ſiſter</hi> Sodome <hi>was not mentioned.</hi> God dealt ſo ſeverely with <hi>Sodome, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha,</hi> and the other Cities, that all ſhould hear thereof, might be inſtructed, and feare to offend that God which can at his pleaſure raine fire and brimſtone. Though judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were executed long before, yet the Lord would not have men forget them, but keep them freſh in memory and advantage themſelves by them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Goe to my place which was in</hi> Shilo, <hi>where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſſe of my people.</hi> They had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the judgement of <hi>Hophny</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and the Ark, and therefore he minds them of it. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 78.60. <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.6. he mentions it unto them.</p>
                     <p>There are no judgments of God in the world or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but men ought to mind them, &amp; make uſe of them. The drowning of the old world, confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> 7 years famine in <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the ten plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the fiery Serpents in the Wilderneſſe, Earth opening her mouth, and ſwallowing up <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh, Senacheribs</hi> Army, <hi>Jezabel, Ahab</hi> and his ſonnes, <hi>Baal's</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Athaliah, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe and many others ought to be thought upon to awake our ſecure Spirits to breed and maintain feare in us, to provoke us to repentance for what is paſt, and more exact walking for time to come. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.32. <hi>Remember Lots wife.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>God hath made Sodome and Gomorrha enſamples to thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly.</hi> There is much in the words <hi>that after ſhould live:</hi> what, hath God turn'd thoſe Cities into aſhes? ſet them up as burning Beacons, to warn all in the world that they live not ungodly? and ſhall their very ſinnes be found in Cities and families? will any dare to doe ſuch things as draw downe ſuch judgements? ſurely none will? if they doe, they muſt ſuffer ſuch things for their ſins, and

                     <p>Some refer this time to the dayes of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wicked. In his reigne <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> 2 K. 16.6. the <hi>Edomites</hi> &amp; <hi>Philiſtims</hi> invaded the land, &amp; brought <hi>Judah</hi> low, and <hi>Tiglath Pilezer,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> whom hee ſent for to help him, diſtreſſed him, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. and helped him not, though he gave him the gold and ſilver of the Temple, a portion of his own, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This was a great reproach that they were impoveriſht, diſappointed, and ſpoyled: And in the time of this diſtreſſe did <hi>Ahaz</hi> treſpaſſe yet more againſt the Lord.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Breaking of the covenant by ſinning againſt God, is a ſlighting and deſpiſing of the threats and curſes of God: <hi>Thou haſt deſpiſed the oath in breaking the covenant.</hi>

                     <p>Now if men did not ſlight and deſpiſe threatning, wrath, curſes, they would not dare to ſin, and break covenant with God; they think words are but wind, that threatnings are but ſcar-crowes, having no great matter in them; or if they have, they will not ſuddenly come, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. When the Lord threatned deſtruction to the Prince, people, Cities,

                     <p>When a man reproacheth and ſlaunders another privily, he deſpiſeth that branch of the oath, <hi>curſed be he that ſmiteth his neighbour ſecretly.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Deſpiſing of the law is a deſpiſing of God, judging both to be little worth: Shall the infinite, wiſe, great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God <hi>magnifie</hi> his law, and make it honourable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. yea <hi>magnifie it above all his name,</hi> Pſal. 138.2.

                     <p>What covenant this was is to be opened. When this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ſo grievouſly ſinn'd, as to be in a great part ruin'd, and the reſt ſent into captivity to outward view, God ſeem'd to have no people; the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob,</hi> that in their ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, ſeem'd to be void, and the Covenant made between God and them at Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi> wholly diſſolv'd; but however things appeared, it was otherwiſe: God min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Covenant, and would eſtabliſh it with the remnant of them; and make additions of more grace and mercy to it, before he gave them the Law in Tables of ſtone, now hee would write it in their hearts, and give them power to keep it. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. you have the Covenant ſet downe which our prophet here meanes, and it's cal'd a <hi>new Covenant,</hi> becauſe of the new addition and new admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, not that the ſubſtance of it is altered: It's the ſame law is written in the hearts of thoſe God makes his Covenant with, as was writ in the tables of ſtone.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61577:181"/> them, and ſhew mercy to them. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had grievouſly ſin'd, deſpis'd the oath, broken covenant, deſerv'd as ill at Gods hands as could be; but what ſaith God; <hi>Nevertheleſſe I will, &amp;c.</hi> However the people of God ſin, however he deale with them for a ſeaſon, yet hee will not altogether take mercy from them. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.13. <hi>They forſooke the Lord, and ſerved Baal and Aſhtorath; whereupon God ſold them into the hands of their enemies round about: God was againſt them for evill, and they were greatly diſtreſſed.</hi> Verſ. 16. <hi>Nevertheleſſe the Lord raiſed them up Judges, which delivered them out of the hand of their ſpoilers.</hi> Pſal. 106.78. <hi>They underſtood not the workes of God in Aegypt, nor remembred the multitude of his mercies, but provoked him at the Sea, even at the Red Sea. Nevertheleſſe he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them for his name ſake.</hi> Pſal. 89.31, 32, 33. <hi>If they break my ſtatutes, and keepe not my commandements, I will viſite their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe my loving kindneſſe will I not utterly take from you.</hi> Iſa. 57.17, 18. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſſe I was wrath, and ſmote him, and hid me, and was wrath, he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> This was bad enough: and though God hid himſelfe, yet he ſaw what hee did. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes,</hi> croſſe, perverſe, provoking. <hi>Nevertheleſſe I will heale him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſets out the glory and greatneſſe of divine mercy: Are a people rich in ſinning? God is rich in mercy; are their ſins great? his mercies are greater; are their ſinnes olde? his mercies are from everlaſting. Let not ſowre, hard, ſinking thoughts lodge in our breaſts, what-ever our ſins have been. Pſalm 147.11. <hi>The Lord hath pleaſure in thoſe hope in his mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2: However men forget their promiſes, covenants, yea break them; yet God will not forget his promiſes, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>I will remember my covenant.</hi> Though man had a ſtrict charge not to forget the covenant: Deut. 4.23. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves leſt yee forget the covenant of the Lord your God.</hi> Yet he forgate it; yet God doth not ſo, he is a God forgets not covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. <hi>He is mindfull of it,</hi> Pſal. 111.5. <hi>He

                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> juſtifies God in this point of his faithfulneſſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervably. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord which hath given reſt unto his people Iſrael, according to all that he promiſed, there hath not failed one word of all his good promiſe which he promiſed by the hand of Moſes his ſervant.</hi> So in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.14. ſaith he, <hi>I am going the way of all the earth, and ye know, in all your hearts, and in all your ſoules, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God ſpake concerning you, all are come to paſſe unto you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore doubting of Gods performance is a great ſin; to diſtruſt him cannot faile us or deceive us is intollerable; we apprehend it ſo through weakneſſe of grace and ſtrength of corruption. Pſal. 89.39. <hi>Thou haſt made void the covenant of thy ſervant.</hi> Becauſe things went ill, the Church was ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, and many ſuffered hard things, he thought ſo.

                     </p>
                     <p>Let us truſt in the Lord for ever, and truſt perfectly, he is a God of truth, remembers his covenant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.5. <hi>Happy is he whoſe hope is in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>It ſhould be encouragement to prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.49. <hi>Lord where are thy former loving kindneſſes which thou ſwareſt unto David in thy truth.</hi> Pſal. 74.20. <hi>Have reſpect unto the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</hi> The covenant with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Abraham</hi> father of all the faithfull now, and we may preſſe God with

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Mercies come from God to a people through the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or for the Covenants ſake: had not the Lord beene in Covenant with this people, he would have minded them no more then other Nations: but becauſe he had made a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them in the dayes of their youth, therefore he would ſhew mercy, doe for them. 2 King. 13.23. <hi>The Lord was gracious unto them, and had reſpect unto them, and compaſſion on them becauſe of his covenant with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.</hi> Though they were very wicked, murmuring, provoked God many wayes, yet for his Covenant-ſake he did ſhew them kindneſſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.42. <hi>He gave them quailes, water out of the rocke:</hi> and why? did they deſerve it: no, <hi>for he remembred his holy promiſe, and Abraham his ſervant. Moſes</hi> knew this, and therefore when the people had ſin'd, ſo as that God was reſolv'd to deſtroy them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. Calfe, &amp;c. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. he ſets upon God with this argument; <hi>Remember Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, and Iſrael thy ſervant, unto whom thou ſwareſt by thine owne ſelfe.</hi> As it's a great condeſcenſion in God to make Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with any, ſo it's unſpeakable mercy to thoſe that are in Covenant with him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When a Covenant is ſhaken, broken, fallen to the earth, and null'd on mans part, God can raiſe it up again; <hi>I will eſtabliſh.</hi> Jeruſalem had ſin'd, ſuffered grievous things, was carryed into Babylon, abode there 70. yeares, and lay buryed as in a grave, the Jewes were even out of hope, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. <hi>Our bones are dryed, our hope is loſt, and we are cut off for our parts.</hi> But in the next verſe ſaith God, <hi>O my people I will open your graves, cauſe you to come up out of them, and bring you into the land of Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. When God doth renew the covenant with his people, he makes ſome comfortable, or gracious additions; as when an houſe, Towne, or City are repaired or new built, ſome enlargements or beautifyings there are, which were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So here, <hi>I will eſtabliſh to thee an everlaſting covenant.</hi> The Covenant before, they brake; but this was a Covenant they
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61577:183"/> ſhould not breake, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. Therefore this Covenant is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. to be <hi>a better covenant, and eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> The promiſes are; <hi>That he will write his law in their hearts: That all ſhall know him from,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That he will forgive their iniquity, and remember their ſin no more.</hi> Theſe promiſes are better.</p>

                     <p>Second editions have additions. <hi>Adam</hi> had the promiſe. <hi>Abraham</hi> more fully, &amp;c. with an oath.</p>

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61577:185"/> new ſpirits, be their God, owne them for his people, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their corn and fruit: and what upon all this? <hi>Then ſhal ye remember your own evill wayes, and your doings, that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your owne ſight for your iniquities and for your abhominations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When God did let out love, ſhew kindneſſe, and multiply mercy, then did they remember to purpoſe their evill ways, how they had prophan'd his Name, his Sanctuary, rejected his Counſell, his Ordinances, his Prophets; deſpiſed his threatnins, broken <hi>Covenant,</hi> apoſtatized from him, turn'd idolaters, became heath'niſh, yea worſe then heath'niſh, and loathed themſelves for ſuch things.</p>
                     <p>Undeſerved, or unexpected kindneſſes do work upon the hearts of men have any ingenuity in them; they are coales of fire, and will warm, yea thawe a frozen icie heart. <hi>Pro.</hi> 25.21, 22. <hi>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eate, and if he be thirſty, give him water to drink, for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coales of fire on his head.</hi> Thy kindneſſes will work in his head and heart, make him reaſon thus: why ſhould I think, ſpeak or doe evill to this man who is ſo loving? who relieves me in my neceſſities, and preſerves my life? ah! what a wretch was I that had ſuch hard thoughts, ſpake ſuch bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words, and did ſo ill by him, I will never think, ſpeak, or doe ſo more: Here are coales upon his head and heart, that have warm'd and melted him to good purpoſe. If mans kindneſſe prove ſuch coales, how much more wil the Lords? When he heaps kindneſſe upon a people unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, undeſervedly, they will be coales of Juniper, cauſing a flame in their boſoms, making them to ſay, ah what have we done, how have we ſin'd againſt a God of love, againſt mercy, againſt grace? wee'll doe it no more. Ezek. 6.9. <hi>They that eſcape of you ſhall remember me among the nations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall be carried captives, and they ſhall loath themſelves for the evills which they have committed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When God did give them their lives for a prey, which was a great mercy; this affected them, cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how they had ſin'd againſt God, and to loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61577:186"/> for what they had done: If common mercies will do this, much more covenant-mercies, which was the caſe here.</p>
                     <p>So when Chriſt look't upon <hi>Peter,</hi> how did it affect and break his heart, make him goe out and weep bitterly for what he had done, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.61, 62. It was a covenant-look, ſuch a look as had influence into his heart, and made him to thinke with himſelfe; what, will the Lord Chriſt vouchſafe to look upon me, who denyed him to be my Lord and Maſter? who denyed that I knew him? who forſware him? will he yet mind me?

                     </p>
                     <p>While Chriſt lay in the Sacrifices and Ceremonies, in the Propheſies and Promiſes, he was a dark hidden thing, like a root under ground: but when God ſent him into the world, then he was as an Enſign lifted up; then he cauſed the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to ſee him, and ſeeke to him, and Jeruſalem the place of his reſt was glorious. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.20, 21. <hi>Zion</hi> ſhould have ſo many children come in from the Nations, that ſhe ſhould ſay, who hath begotten me theſe? It was the Lord begate them by the power of his ſpirit, he made them to run unto Chriſt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. read the 60. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> conſider and obſerve the concluſion, <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time.</hi> And he did ſo, powring out his ſpirit upon the Apoſtles, whom he ſent abroad into the Nations to preach Chriſt and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to bring all their brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all Nations unto his holy mountain Jeruſalem (that was the Chriſtian Church) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.20. So the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was given to the Gentiles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They made ſubjects of Chriſt, and that fulfil'd which you have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.30, 31. <hi>A ſeed ſhall ſerve him, it ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation; they ſhall come and ſhall declare his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto a people that ſhall he borne.</hi> That hee hath done this, the Lord did it, and that powerfully, nothing could hinder, neither ignorance, prophaneſſe, nor unbelief.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When Nations or any People receive the Goſpel of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61577:188"/> Chriſt, they have a new relation put upon them, they are <hi>daughters</hi> of Jeruſalem: not Jeruſalem in a literall or carnall notion, but of Jeruſalem in a ſpirituall and myſticall ſenſe, as it notes out the Church, which is the Spouſe of Chriſt and God. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. Chriſt and the Church are a great myſtery. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. The church is cal'd the <hi>Lambs wife.</hi> So Chap. 21.9. and ſhe is <hi>the mother of the faithfull,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of them; for ſhee brings forth, and with difficulty. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.2. The woman cloathed with the Sun, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtian Church, was with child, fell into labour, and was pained to be delivered: and when any are born of the Spirit, and immortall ſeed of the word, they are her children, and their priviledges are great, I will name two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God will be their Teacher, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord:</hi> And, <hi>who teacheth like him,</hi> Job 36.22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ſhall have peace, yea great peace: <hi>Great ſhall be the peace of thy children,</hi> Iſa. 54.13. Pſal. 119.165. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> They are taught of God, and cannot but love the law of God: <hi>Therefore let us walk as children of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14, 15. <hi>As obedient children, not faſhioning our ſelves according to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer luſts, in our ignorance: but as he which hath call'd us is holy, ſo let us be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> It's an honour to be a ſon or daughter of <hi>Sion.</hi> Pſal. 87.5. <hi>Of Sion it ſhall be ſaid, this and that man was born in her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. When holy things are abuſed, many times, God ownes them not, but calls them theirs that have abuſed them, as here; <hi>thy Covenant.</hi> Jeruſalem had broken the oath, and deſpiſed the Covenant, and God calls it her Covenant. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices.</hi> 14. <hi>Your new moons and your appointed feaſts my ſoule hateth.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. People are apt to think, who are in relation to God, that for their ſakes God doth much. Jeruſalem was neare unto God, he had taken her to be his: and ſhe thought when the Gentiles ſhould be given into her for daughters, it was
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61577:189"/> for her ſake; but the Lord tell's no, it's not for thy ſake, thou haſt not kept covenant with me, nor pleaſed me; thou couldſt not challenge any ſuch thing at my hands, hadſt thou walked never ſo exactly, much leſſe now, having wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contrary unto me; It's not for thy covenant. When God ſhewed mercy to the Jewes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.32. <hi>Not for their ſakes do I this ſaith the Lord God, be it known unto you.</hi> You may think it's ſo, but it's otherwiſe.</p>

                     <p>The knowledg here meant is not common knowledg, but a ſaying knowledg; not a legall, but an Evangelical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; for he ſpeaks not of that knowledg which riſes from afflictions and judgements, of which he had oft ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6, 7.13: 7.4.9: 11.10.12: 12.20: 13.9.14.21.23: 14.8: 15.7: Thirteen times the Lord ſaith, <hi>they ſhould know that he was the Lord,</hi> that it was by his judgments; but here he ſpeaks of ſuch knowledg as ſprings from a fountain and foundation of mercy. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know me:</hi> That is, in another manner then thou didſt before; thou ſhalt know me ſpiritually, with a knowledg of faith and ſalvation: ſo much the word know imports in <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.4. Now this knowledge differs from vulgar, legall, and literall knowledg; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It's a more diſtinct knowledg of God, humane is more mixt, dark, and confuſed. <hi>Job</hi> 10.22. <hi>The light is is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> Every ungodly man's light is darkneſſe; but hee hath light from God in <hi>Covenant,</hi> his light is cleare. Prov. 13.9. <hi>The light of the righteous rejoyceth.</hi> If it were confus'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, it would not rejoyce. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The wiſdome from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove is pure:</hi> and the more pure, the more cleare, the more diſtinct.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:61577:190"/>2. It's a ſavory, reliſhing knowledg, the ſoule is affected with it: <hi>Taſt and ſee that the Lord is good.</hi> No meate, no wine, no ſpice taſts more pleaſant to the palate of a man, then the goodneſſe of God doth to a man hath the ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thereof. <hi>Experientia &amp; examen mentis dicitur guſtus,</hi> R. <hi>David,</hi> taſting notes knowledg and experience, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.18. <hi>She perceiveth that her merchandiſe is good:</hi> The Heb. word is, <hi>ſhe taſteth.</hi> The gaine of her labour is pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.31. Manna had a taſt like wafers, made of hony. The true knowledg and taſt of God is as ſweet as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gaine, as ever Manna was. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>His fruit was ſweet to my taſt,</hi> and his knowledg hath a ſavour in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's a deep-rooted and wel-ſetled knowledg. Job 38.36. <hi>Who hath put wiſdome in the inward parts? or who hath given underſtanding to the heart?</hi> the Lord doth it to thoſe he ſtrikes his Covenant with: <hi>thou ſhalt know mee.</hi> Thou ſhalt have a deeper and more rooted and ſetled knowledge then others. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts:</hi> Not in our heads only, not on our hearts only, but in our hearts. God ſeats the knowledg of himſelfe in the hearts of his; he puts and writes his law in their hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. Wicked men have knowledg &amp; light in their heads, but darkneſſe in their hearts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It's a knowledg diſtinguiſhable from other knowledge by the effects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It's peaceable, and cauſeth men to live peaceably, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The wiſdome from above it pure and peaceable.</hi> Iſa. 11.9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountaine, for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When men know God ſavingly, they love peace, and purſue peace: but when knowledg is literall, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and bitter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It humbleth much; the more men know God in his holineſſe, glory, and goodneſſe, the more humble they will be. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.42, 43. <hi>Yee ſhall know that I am the Lord, and remember your wayes and doings: And ye ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for all your evils that you have done.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:61577:190"/> had a cleare and ſpirituall ſight of God, he abhor'd himſelfe in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.5. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Woe is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.9.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's working and powerfull; like fire it conſumes the luſts of mens hearts, and ſeparates the droſſe of their ſpirits, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. The truth purified their ſoules. Pſal. 119.34. <hi>Give me underſtanding and I ſhall keep thy law, yea I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart.</hi> Divine knowledge keepes under what hinders practiſe, and leads out the ſoule to action. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith he knows God, and keeps not his commandements, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> Men have not the true knowledg of God when their luſts over-power them, and make them diſobedient.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Truſt and confidence in the Lord; the knowledg wee ſpeak of hath certainty in it, and cauſeth venturing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy name will put their truſt in thee.</hi> They that know God ſpiritually, his truths, promiſes, covenant, faithfulneſſe, will reſign up themſelves to him, and lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. What is the bottome and ground of the Prophets exhortation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> When a man hath the true, reall, and cleare knowledg of this, he will truſt in God. <hi>David</hi> had the right knowledg of God, he ſaid of him, <hi>He is my refuge and my fortreſſe, my God, in him will I truſt,</hi> Pſal. 91.2.</p>

Zach. 12.10. <hi>I will powre upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Jeruſalem the ſpirit of grace and of ſupplication: and they ſhall looke upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only ſonne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When men are in covenant with God, and have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual knowledg of his love and bounty, in giving Chriſt to take away ſin, and looke upon him in his piercings and ſufferings by, and for their ſins, then will they mourn with a great, but a ſpirituall mourning, which is the moſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and acceptable. When we apprehend God to have taken us into Covenant with him, to be our God, to have done great things for us, to have promiſed great things to us, and to have been very good to us, then the remembrance of our wretched wayes cauſeth a holy ſhame, and a holy ſorrow.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe who rightly know God in the covenant of grace wil not murmure againſt, or accuſe God for any of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them, but be ſilent and ſubmiſſive before him: They know God is infinitely wiſe, juſt, and holy, that all their afflictions, chaſtiſements, troubles, temptations, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings are exceeding ſhort of what they deſerve; that nothing comes to paſſe without his providence; that hee can wrong none; that he doth uſe unholy inſtruments holily, and hath holy ends in all his ways. Till men know the Lord ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, in a covenant and Goſpel-manner, they are apt to open their mouths, to accuſe and blame God; yea oft they utter unſavory ſpeeches, but when it's known, it's other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Job 1.22. <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly.</hi> He met with very hard things; but knowing God the right way, he opened not his mouth againſt him, but for him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61577:192"/> my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> He was ſilent, and patiently ſubmitted unto the hand of God; hee neither accus'd him, nor excus'd himſelf: If I be reproach'd, perſecuted, afflicted any way, I know it's thy doings, and I will be dumb.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Abſolom</hi> that rebellious and unnatural ſon had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>David</hi> out of all, and ſought his life; what ſaid he to it? <hi>If God have no delight in me, behold here am I, let him doe to me as ſeemeth good to him.</hi> If he will have me cut off, and cut down by the hand of mine own wicked ſon, I am content: if hee will have me driven out from the holy City and Land, and live in a prophane land amongſt his enemies, I leave it to him, let him do what he pleaſes, I know what I have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. When God ſent out a fire which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for offering ſtrange fire, it was a ſadde affliction even for a godly parent, and might have made <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> open his mouth; but ſaith the Text, <hi>he held his peace,</hi> Lev. 10.3. It's fit all fleſh ſhould be ſilent before the Lord, as it's <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.13. And that <hi>every mouth ſhould be ſtop'd,</hi> Rom. 3.19. But moſt mouths are open againſt God, more or leſſe; only thoſe have ſpiritual knowledg of him, and ſpiritual ſorrow for their ſins, are moſt ſilent, what condition ſoever they be caſt into; they will ſay with the Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.9. <hi>We will beare the indignation of the Lord, becauſe wee have ſinned againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sin is ſuch an evil as provokes God: <hi>when I am pacified towards thee,</hi> There can be no pacification where there is no provocation. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Then was the Kings wrath pacified. Haman</hi> had offended <hi>Ahaſſuerus</hi> before, and being hang'd for it, his wrath was pacified. Eccl. 10.4. <hi>Yielding pacifieth great offences.</hi> If there were not offence, no place would be found for pacification: where this is to be made, provocation hath gone before. Sin is that provokes a God of patience &amp; long ſuffering, it makes him angry and wrathfull. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.8. <hi>Ye provoke me to wrath.</hi> Sin provokes him bitterly, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.13. and makes him <hi>angry every day,</hi> Pſal. 7.11. Yea it provokes him to <hi>jealouſie,</hi> 1 <hi>K.</hi> 14.22. Let us take heed of ſin, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God any way; to kindle his anger but a little is a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61577:193"/> dangerous thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Paul</hi> knew it when he ſaid, <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie, are we ſtronger then he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.22. We would not provoke a Lyon, a man of War, ſuch an one as <hi>Smapſon</hi> was: and ſhall we provoke God, who puts all ſtrength into beaſts and men, who is a roaring Lyon and the Lord of hoſts?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Though ſin do provoke God greatly &amp; bitterly, yet he is to be pacified: <hi>when I am pacified towards you,</hi> he is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacifyable. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. He ſaith, <hi>I will not keep anger for ever.</hi> His mercy endures for ever, but not his anger; his wrath is momentany, but his <hi>kindneſſe is everlaſting,</hi> Iſa. 54.8. <hi>Aaron</hi> made an attonement for the people, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.46. <hi>Phinehas</hi> turn'd away his wrath, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Moſes</hi> prevail'd with God, and pacified him when he was very angry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.14. <hi>The Lord is a God ready to pardon,</hi> Neh. 9.17. Though men have ſin'd much, long, provoked exceedingly; yet if they ſue unto him, he is facile and ready to forgive. When the man ought 10000. talents came to the Lord for patience, <hi>have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;</hi> He hid not only forbeare him, but forgave him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.26, 27. With men it fals out oft, that they will never forgive: but the Lord is forward to it: And when the people were full of ſinne, had greatly treſpaſſed; <hi>He being full of compaſſion, forgave their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, and deſtroyed them not; yea many a time turned he his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath,</hi> Pſal. 78.38.</p>
                     <p>When man perſiſts in ſin, God ceaſeth from his wrath, and reacheth out mercy. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, 18. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heale him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Gods being pacified towards a people is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which appears herein two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All that hath offended is pas'd by and forgiven: <hi>When I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done:</hi> Not for one, two, or three, or an hundred things done, but for all done; thy Idolatry, Oppreſſion, Pride, Fulneſſe of bread, Idleneſs, Neglect of the poore, Injuſtice, Prophaneſſe, &amp;c When God is once pacified, he is fully pacified for all ſins. And here is <hi>magnitudo gratiae divinae,</hi> be ſins never ſo great, old, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they are all done away.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="377" facs="tcp:61577:193"/>2. He is ſo pacified, as that he will not be angry againe with them for thoſe evill deeds. I told you in the opening the words, that <hi>Caphar</hi> notes ſuch covering of them, as they cannot eaſily be ſeen again; expiation, blotting out. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> God ſo blots out when he is pacified, as not to remember them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. God being in Covenant, and ſo pacified towards his people, he is <hi>mercifull to their unrighteouſneſſe, and their iniquity will he remember no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Jer. 50.20. <hi>The iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſinnes of Judah, and they ſhall not be found.</hi>

                     <p>The Papiſts aſſert the Scriptures are obſcure. <hi>Barradius</hi> the Jeſuite ſaith they are aenigmatical, and brings this place for it. <hi>Sonne of man, put forth a riddle, ſpeake a parable unto the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> but he forgat the explication of the riddle and parable afterwards in the Chap. And the Father ſaith, if a thing be ſpoken obſcurely in one place it's cleared up in another.</p>
                     <p>We grant there are riddles, parables, hard and deep things in the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. and many places in the <hi>Revelations</hi> and other Books, are difficult, obſcure, and the wiſdome of God is ſeene in it: For hereby mans pride is ſtained and beaten downe, his abilities what ever, morall or ſpiritual exercis'd, and the dignity of Scripture kept up; but in things neceſſary to ſalvation it's plaine and eaſie. <hi>Timothy</hi> knew the Scriptures when he was a child, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And they are compared unto a light, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19 ſhining in a dark place: And Chriſt gives thanks, that the Father hid the things of the Goſpel from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and reveal'd them unto babes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith the Scriptures are ſo divinely written,<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>3.</hi> de Laza. &amp; hom. <hi>10.</hi> ad <hi>Philip.</hi>
                        </note> that all may read them profitably, both idiots and Artiſts.</p>
                     <p>The holy Scriptures are frequent in parables; ſome ſay they are as many as the weeks in the yeare, 52. our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Chriſt doe much parabolize. The uſe of parables is,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="381" facs="tcp:61577:195"/>1. To veile divine things, and keep them ſecret from the knowledg of prophane and wicked ſpirits, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.13, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To help the memory: Parables are taken from things obvious to the ſenſes, and ſo make a ſtronger impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the memory; as ſimilies are better remembred then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truths, they take ſtronger hold of a mans memory: ſo parables.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To ſtir and quicken the affections and ſpirits of men. There is a ſweetneſs in truths conveyed by parables, ſo that they pleaſe &amp; provoke to a further inquiſition after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. When Chriſt had ſpoken in parables, the Diſciples came to him and ſaid, declare unto us theſe parables, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.36. <hi>Ch.</hi> 15.15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To convince, and that ſtrongly. When <hi>David</hi> ſinned greatly in ſlaying <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and defiling <hi>Bathſheba. Nathan</hi> came with a Parable unto him of a rich man having Flocks and Heards, and a poore man having one Lamb, which the rich man took from the poor man, and ſlew for his friend. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hearing this, gives ſentence: <hi>As the Lord liveth, the man hath done this thing ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> Saith <hi>Nathan, Thou art the man.</hi> Now <hi>Davids</hi> mouth was ſtopt, the conviction ſtrong, he had ſentenced himſelfe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the parable of the houſholder letting out his Vineyard to Husbandmen, who beat his ſervants, and ſlew his ſon: <hi>when the Lord comes what will he doe to thoſe men:</hi> They being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of this great injuſtice, paſſe ſentence againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſay, <hi>he will miſerably deſtroy thoſe wicked men,</hi> Mat. 21.41.</p>
                     <p>It's the third uſe our Prophet intends here, <hi>viz.</hi> to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their attention, affections, and ſpirits to thoſe things he was to commend unto them; which had they been in a common and familiar ſtyle, they would not have liſten'd unto: but being in a parabolizing way, they cauſed the greater attention, and made the ſtronger impreſſion.</p>

                     <p>Prophane Authors make an Eagle an embleme of majeſty and greatneſſe.

Dan. 2.20, 21. <hi>Wiſdome and might are his, he changeth times and ſeaſons.</hi> The times of all States, Empires, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in his hand, and hee removes the Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of them at his pleaſure: <hi>Job</hi> tels us, <hi>he looſeth the bond of Kings,</hi> Chap. 12.18. The bond of Kings is their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the laws &amp; covenants by which people are bound unto them, the Lord takes away the one, and makes people regardleſſe of the other. <hi>He leads Princes away ſpoiled, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows the mighty,</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>He poureth contempt upon Princes.</hi> Thus did he deale by <hi>Jehoiachin,</hi> he looſed his bond, led him away, ſpoiled and made him contemptible.</p>

                     <p>If Kings would not have God to looſe their bonds, let them take heed how they break his bonds, and goe beyond the bounds of Religion and juſtice which he ſets them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

God mingles mercy with judgements; yea when they are great, ſharp, proclaim the ſeverity of God; yet even then there is ſome matter of comfort twiſted together with them; if there be ſeverity on the one hand, there is goodneſſe in the other.</p>
                     <p>It ſeem'd to be the height of rigour to pull <hi>Jehoiachin</hi> a young King from the Throne, and to deprive him and the Nobles of all the comforts that <hi>Canaan, Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple could afford, but it was not: their limbs might have been pul'd from them, their eyes put out, their lives taken away; but theſe are ſpar'd, and they are ſeated, not in a Country-village, but in a City, and a City of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that ſo they might have commerce with men of quality, be taken up with merchandizing affairs, and not mind their loſſes too much.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. God prevents mens expectations, and raiſes up to that honour and greatneſſe they looked not for.

                     <p n="7">7. The diſpoſing of ſubdued Kingdomes is a difficult work, and requires wiſdome, care, and caution. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> had ſubdued the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and what doth he? he wiſely takes <hi>of the ſeed of the land,</hi> not of the ſeed of <hi>Babylon,</hi> not a ſtranger, which would have bred diviſions, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wars, and blood, but one of themſelves, and places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and that with circumſpection: Hee made things ſure as he could for himſelfe, and ſure for <hi>Zedekiah</hi> whom he planted amongſt, and ſet over the people; he was very circumſpect in this weighty buſineſſe: ſo the word <hi>ſaph-ſaphah</hi> ſignifies: men of this world are wiſe in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This K. when he took away <hi>Jehoiachin,</hi> carried away all <hi>Jeruſalem, and all the Princes, and all the mighty men of valour, tenne thouſand captives: and all the Craftſmen and Smiths, the Kings wives and his officers, and all that were apt for warre, and none remained ſave the pooreſt ſort of the land,</hi> 2 King. 24.14, 15, 16. He tooke away all that might be of uſe to the new King, he would leave him none to give him ill counſell, or aſſiſt him in ill enterprizes; he planted him by great waters, among multitudes of poor people, that had little for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and leſſe for their King.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Tributary Princes and Kingdomes at firſt are reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and gratefull to thoſe that they depend upon. <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was planted by <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in Judea, <hi>and his branches turned towards him, and his roots were under him:</hi> Himſelfe, and thoſe belonged to him acknowledged their dependance on <hi>Nebuchadnezar.</hi> Kindneſſe, favour, is to be owned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61577:204"/> though from Strangers and Heathens. He <hi>ſent</hi> to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar,</hi> Jer. 29.3. yea he <hi>went</hi> to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.59. So that he was very obſervable of him: and while he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this condition of being under that potent King, and faithfull in keeping Covenant, and performing Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles agreed upon, he and the Kingdome thrived; it's ſaid of him, <hi>hee grew and became a ſpreading vine, which brought forth branches, and ſhot forth twigs.</hi> He grew in eſtate, in children, in Nobles, in Offices and Officers; he came to the condition of a vine, yea a ſpreading Vine that hath leaves and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When the glory and ſtrength of a Kingdome is marr'd and broken by warres, it doth not eaſily recover it's priſtine condition, if ever. The Kingdome of Judah, after <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> plundering and ſpoiling of it, in time became a vine, but <hi>of low ſtature,</hi> in all <hi>Zedekiah's</hi> dayes it did not recover it ſelfe. When a tree is cropt, it requires time to grow up againe, and it may be never attains its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer height and glory. This Kingdome was a tall Cedar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now it was a low ſhrub; it had not that wealth, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, dignity, greatneſſe it had before. If a Family or Town be ruined by wars, it may be 7. years before they get up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and 7. to that, much more when Kingdomes are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, batter'd, wounded.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. See hence the inſtability of all earthly greatneſſe. Kings and Kingdoms that were high and moſt flouriſhing, are ſoon brought low: The Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, powerfull, like the higheſt Cedar upon the hill of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon:</hi> but it continued not, it ſuffered many changes.

                     <p>The Kingly office is honourable, and when God ſets up Kings over people, they might be happy, and grow potent. <hi>Solomon</hi> who was a wiſe King, he proſpered exceedingly in that ſoile he was planted in, and liv'd happily; but <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> his ſonne through his folly and diſcontentedneſs with his people, loſt 10. parts of his kingdome, and made his reign troubleſome afterwards, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> by his folly and diſcontent undid himſelfe, being impatient of the yoake God had put upon him, he fooliſhly ſends to, and relies upon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and thinks by Aegyptian hands to re-lift himſelfe into a better condition than God had put him in, but this was his ruine.

                     <p>Judgements threatned are not readily and eaſily believed; if ſo, there need no ſwearing to confirme the certainty of them; but man as he is backward to believe what ſhould do him good; ſo what is threaten'd and tends unto his ruine, therefore God ſweares, <hi>as I live Zedekiah ſhall dye. Jeremiah</hi> had often told <hi>Zedekiah</hi> that he ſhould be taken and carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 32.45: 34.23. but he believed it not, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.12. He humbled not himſelfe before <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, ſpeaking from the mouth of the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. he and others mocked the Meſſengers of God, deſpiſed his word, and miſuſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61577:219"/> Much was given out by the Prophets anent the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but none would believe that the enemie ſhould ever have entered into the gates of it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.12. What, God deſtroy his own City? his own people? how can this be? Judgements are ſowr things to the ſpirits of men, very unwelcom, and therefore they ſhift them off with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or other. God is a mercifull God, and will not doe ſuch ſevere things; or if he doe, it will not be in our dayes, as they in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. <hi>The dayes are prolonged:</hi> or if not, <hi>yet we ſhall eſcape.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. God is ſo reſolv'd upon the puniſhing of perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he ſweares unto it: <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, ſeeing hee hath deſpiſed the oath, and broken the covenant, he ſhall dye.</hi> And againe, <hi>As I live I will recompence it upon his owne head.</hi> Himſelfe, his Princes, falſe Prophets, may think, hope, ſay, ſweare it will be otherwiſe; but as ſure as I live, as I am God, he &amp; they ſhall feel the weight of my diſpleaſure for their perfidiouſneſſe &amp; perjury. Kings on the Earth take oaths &amp; little regard them, but the K. of heaven doth not ſo. If the Lord once ſweare, he will perform, and there is no poſſibility of eſcaping. Perjury is a ſinne which violates the name of God exceedingly, and evidences that men have no feare of God in them, that they make an Idoll of him to ſerve their own turns; That ſuch men are neither for God nor man to truſt; not only Religion, but even common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty ſuffers by them. No marvail then that the Lord ſwears, and ſwears again, that he will recompence ſuch ſinnes upon mens heads.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such is the condition of humane affaires, that even Kings and great men may fall into the hands, and dye in the hands of forreign enemies. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and even with him <hi>in the midſt of</hi> Babylon <hi>hee ſhall dye.</hi> He made no account of meeting with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and dying in that place, but his ſins brought thoſe evils upon him. <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Pharaoh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> and was carryed to Aegypt, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.4. <hi>Jehoiachin</hi> with his Princes, Officers, and mighty men was a captive in

                     <p n="1">1. Men looke for help from an arme of fleſh when in ſtreights. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> expected that <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> mighty Armie, and great company, his Chariots and Horſes ſhould make for him. It's very incident to us to looke unto ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and creature-help more then Gods. <hi>Aſa</hi> being in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe did ſo: <hi>he relyed</hi> ſaith the Text <hi>on the King of Syria, and not on the Lord his God,</hi> 2 Chron. 16.7. And in his diſeaſe <hi>he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians,</hi> verſ. 12. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in man is a common practice of the ſons of men. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> he ſent to the King of Aſſyria to help him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.16. So <hi>Ephraim</hi> when he ſaw his ſickneſſe, hee went to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Jareb,</hi> Hoſ. 5.13. Mens ſpirits looke any way, tunne any whither for reliefe rather then unto God; the arme of fleſh is more to them then the arme of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Some truſt in chariots, ſome in horſes, ſome in riches,</hi> Pſal. 52.7. Some in <hi>falſhood,</hi> Jer. 23.25. Some in <hi>ſtrong holds,</hi> Zech. 9.3. Some in <hi>men,</hi> Iſa. 2.22. But it argues Atheiſme, Ignorance, Pride, Unbeliefe, that men looke not unto God at ſuch times; yea, it proclaims the baſeneſſe of our ſpirits, that wee fall upon what is viſible, weake, unfaithfull, at diſtance, and neglect God who is ſtrong, all-ſufficient, neare; and all becauſe inviſible, not ſeene of us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Divine providence over-rules and orders things ſo, that wicked men are fruſtrated and diſappointed of their hopes and expectations. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> hoped and expected that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his great Forces ſhould make much for him; but <hi>neither ſhall Pharaoh with his mighty Army and great company make for him:</hi> It is not Kings, Armies, Counſellours, and Counſells will doe it. <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Armie came forth of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61577:220"/> raiſed the ſiege when <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> was before <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> Jer. 37.11. Yet it did not make for him; the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> returned againe, ſate down before the City, tooke it, <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the Princes, and others. <hi>Ahaz</hi> expected help from the King of <hi>Aſſyria; Tilgath-Pilneſer</hi> comes, and what then? he diſtreſſed him, but ſtrengthened him not, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Abſolom</hi> expected much from the counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> but God turned it into fooliſhneſſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.14. and all the ſtrength he had, made not for him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. Job 5.12. <hi>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterprize. Haman</hi> could not perform his enterprize. <hi>Herod</hi> could not accompliſh his deſign to murther Chriſt when he ſlew the Infants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. Kings and People imagine vaine things, and the Lord laughs them to ſcorn, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1.4. The Lord ſees what fools they are to project, plot, expect help from arms of fleſh, and makes them to ſee, find and feele it in time. He brings <hi>the counſell of the heathen to nought, and makes the devices of people,</hi> Princes, Armies <hi>of none effect, and eſtabliſheth his owne thoughts and counſels,</hi> Pſal. 33.10, 11. and that <hi>to all generations.</hi> God ſerved his owne will upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Armie. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was fruſtrated, hee looked for light, and met with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: He lean'd upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a broken reed, that ran into his hand, and pierced him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. The Armies and Forces raiſed in this Land have not made for the King, nor had the <hi>Scots</hi> that aſſiſtance they looked for,<note place="margin">1648.</note> when they ſo lately came in.

                     <p>Oaths made between man and man are cal'd in Scripture the <hi>oaths of God,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.2.

                     <p>The high Cedar was the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which had the preheminence above the reſt, the head whereof was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David,</hi> out of which came the Kingly race. The higheſt branch of it was <hi>Jehoiachin,</hi> who though in <hi>Babylon,</hi> God look't at, and minded not <hi>Zedekiah</hi> who was perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, his ſons were ſlain, himſelfe laid by, and God would take of <hi>Jehoiachins</hi> ſeed, and from thence raiſe up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Judah. Jehoiachin</hi> who alſo was cal'd <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16. In his captivity was ſaid to beget <hi>Salathiel,</hi> and <hi>Salathiel, Zorobabel,</hi> Matth. 1.12. who was the tender one cropt off from the young twig, as the Jewes expound the place, and make all ſpoken here to be meant of him and his Succeſſors, for hee was the chiefe man that brought them out of <hi>Babylon</hi> unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> again, and reared up the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of <hi>David</hi> and Jewiſh polity.</p>
                     <p>Be it granted that he is included in this allegoricall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet it cannot be principally underſtood of him; for ſomething is here ſpoken that was never verified in him or his Succeſſors according to the Jewiſh account. In the 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>under it ſhall dwell all fowle of every wing.</hi> This is of larger extent then the power of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> or the Jewiſh eſtate reached unto. It clearly points at the kingdom of Chriſt, and all ſorts of people comming under his wing and protection: The evidence whereof hath cauſed ſome abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to interpret all of Chriſt.

                     <p>Under other Cedars there is no ſafetie; Kings of the earth are Cedars, but they prey upon their Subjects rather than protect them: they thinke that all men are made to ſerve their luſts, and therefore minde themſelves, and care not what becomes of the people, ſo they may grow great and fatt on earth; its otherwiſe with Chriſt, he ſeeks the good, the comfort, the ſafetie, the greatneſſe and glory of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

No trees are ſo high, but the Lord who is higher than they, can lay them low, let them be greene with boughes, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, leaves, let them have many children, many Nobles, many Souldiers, many Counſellors, many Kingdomes, all cannot preſerve them from ruine. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a <hi>high tree, his top reached to Heaven,</hi> Dan. 4.11. he was proud and bloudie, and what fell out; <hi>A watcher, an holy One came downe from Heaven, cryed aloud, and ſaid; Hew downe the tree, cut off his branches, ſhake off his leaves, ſcatter his fruit; let the beaſts get away from under it, and the fowles from his branches,</hi> ver. 13, 14.

                     <p n="2">2. The occaſion.

And when the Prophets preſſed the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>I will appoint over them foure kindes, ſaith the Lord, the ſword to ſlay, the dogges to teare, the fowles of heaven, the beaſts of the earth to devoure and deſtroy, and I will cauſe them to be removed into all Kingdomes of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

He made <hi>Judah</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to erre, and do worſe then Heathen, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.9. When God ſtir'd the Prophets to tell them that for his ſins he would lay <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> waſt, as he had the ten Tribes for <hi>Jeroboams</hi> ſins; they then took up this proverbe, and ſaid; <hi>The fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge. Ahaz, Manaſſes, Amon,</hi> and others of our forefathers have ſin'd, and wee muſt ſuffer, or thus; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and his Counſellors had perfidiouſly broken Covenant with <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar,</hi> for which the Prophets threatend utter ruine to all; hereupon the people ſaid, <hi>Our fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge;</hi> the Kings and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have tranſgreſs'd, and wee ſhall be ruin'd for it; but the former occaſion is the better, becauſe <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles did ſuffer with them, and were puniſht for their own ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>This proverb was grown common amongſt them, both in <hi>Babylon</hi> and in <hi>Sion</hi> it was toſſed up and downe and ſpread; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells them of it in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Jeremie</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> Chap. 31.29. <hi>They ſhall ſay no more, the fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, &amp;c.</hi> The evill of this proverbe was great, for beſides their charging of God with injuſtice and partialitie, hereby they diſcovered their fathers ſins and nakedneſſe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow or repentance for them.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That the world might not be unpeopled, for if all ſhould be cut off deſerve death, if every ſoule ſins ſhould die, how few would be left. In the deſtruction of the old world you know how few were ſpared.</p>

Yes, they doe, as in the caſe here, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſin'd, and for his ſins not onely the wicked ones, but <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and other precious ones ſuffered in <hi>Babylon: Zedekiah</hi> ſins, and thoſe that did mourne and ſigh, <hi>Ezek</hi> 9.4. for his and others abominations, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red greatly: ſo on the contrary, for the ſins of godly parents who are in one Covenant, may their children ſuffer, that are under an other, as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.11. <hi>I will raiſe up evill againſt thee out of thine own houſe.

So <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ſin fell heavie upon <hi>Rhehoboam,</hi> 1 Kings 11.11, 12. and Chap. 12.15, 16.20. But there is an obſervable difference in the ſuffering of the children for the ſins of the parents. When the children are gracious, their ſufferings upon the account of their parents ſins are chaſtiſements, mercies, and from love, but where they are ungodly, their ſufferings are reall and true puniſhments coming from divine juſtice and wrath.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a riddle which I beleive will not bee fully expounded till the great day of the Lord; onely thus much may be ſaid beforehand: Men have extended the ſenſe of thoſe words further then God intended, if wee exceed not our limits, but keep to the perſons, time, &amp; matter in hand, wee may make out the difficultie; as thus; the Prophet ſpeaks of the <hi>Jewes</hi> that were already in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhould ſuddenly be brought from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into the ſame captivitie with them, and principally he hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſin of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> as may appeare by 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.11, 12, 13, 14. Chap. 23.26, 27. Chap. 24.3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.4. For which they ſuffered, and made them ſo complain. Now the Lord intimates, yea aſſures them that after their ſuffring in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivitie, he would be ſatisfied, and they ſhould never ſuffer more for the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> but ſhould returne againe, and if they ſuffered afterward, it ſhould be for their own ſins, not his. In this ſenſe you ſee the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cleared, but if you inlarge the words to all times and perſons, its beyond the reach of men to anſwer the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for wee ſee it daily, that one ſins, and others ſuffer for it; parents ſin, and their children ſuffer; Magiſtrates ſin, and Cities ſuffer; Princes ſin, and people ſuffer. The Lord did not deveſt himſelfe here of that power and priviledge of viſiting the iniquities of parents upon the heads of their children, but takes away that accuſation they laid againſt him for ſuffering ſo long and grievous a captivitie for the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61577:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſins of <hi>Manaſſe.</hi> That this is the meaning of the words, and their not uſing the proverbe any more, I am confirm'd out of <hi>Jeremie,</hi> Chap. 31.27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will ſowe the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Judah, with the ſeed of man, and with the ſeed of beaſt, and it ſhall come to paſſe, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break downe, and to throw downe, and to deſtroy, and to afflict; ſo will I watch over them to build, &amp; to plant, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This is meant of their returne from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and what then; <hi>In thoſe dayes they ſhall ſay no more the fathers have eaten a ſowre grape, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge, but every one ſhall die for his own iniquitie.</hi> So then after the returne this proverbe ceaſed, and to thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> that ſuffered upon the account of <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſins; but its ſtill of force to other <hi>Jewes,</hi> and among us Gentiles.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. It's againſt the light and law of nature, which never puts men upon things uncomely and horrible, but ſtartles at them: and ſurely if any ſhould be ſo vile and vitious, to doe ſuch a thing, hee would finde a reluctancy even in nature it ſelfe, unleſſe he be become unnaturall: The <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> have deteſted it, and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in their <hi>Alcoran.</hi>

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61577:246"/> careful of their own ſeed &amp; poſterity, that it may be ſound, ſtrong, comely and uſeful to the publique.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's that which the wiſdome of God hath forbidden, and if there were nothing elſe in it, that is ſufficient. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe as long as ſhe is put apart for her uncleanneſſe.</hi> In this Chapter, unlawful marriages and unlawful luſts are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and it is as unlawful for men to meddle in that caſe as to marry their Mothers, Siſters, Aunts, or Daughters in Laws; the ſame authority that hath forbidden one, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo forbidden the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The puniſhment of this ſin is great, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.18. The man and woman are both to be cut off from among their people; the meaning is, not to be ſeparated from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation as defiled, but they were to dye for their unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable luſts, and approaching near to each other. This may ſeeme very ſevere; but know, if the man did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, he was judged unclean ſeven dayes, and was to waſh and cleanſe himſelfe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15.24.27. But if wittingly and knowingly it were done, they were both to dye for it. Anſwerable to this is what our Prophet ſaith here: <hi>If hee have not come neare to a menſtruous woman he ſhall live. Solomon</hi> underſtood this, when he ſaid, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>There is a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</hi> or as the Heb. hath it, <hi>to be far from embracing:</hi> and no time hath the Lord ſo punctually and ſeverely forbidden it as at that time.

So Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, Bears are favourable to thoſe of their own kind, and prey upon Forreiners, thoſe of another kind; but men moſt unnaturally prey upon one another: <hi>homo homini lupus,</hi> one man is a Wolf to another.

                     <p n="1">1. It's an exerciſe of the underſtanding, mind, heart, theſe are at work in conſideration, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my wayes,</hi> or <hi>conſidered them.</hi> I turn'd them over and over, as Sempſters doe their needle-work: I look upon all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and aggravations of them; it's cal'd a ſpeaking or ſaying, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.2. <hi>They conſider not in their hearts.</hi> Hebrew is, <hi>they ſay not to their hearts.</hi> It's cal'd a communing with a mans own heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Serious; it's not a ſlight generall thinking of a thing but a ſerious ſetled minding of a thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Let us conſider one another,</hi>

                        </gap>, it notes the ſincking downe of a thing into our mindes: it's the intention of the minde upon a thing, <hi>magno ſtudio,</hi> with great earneſtneſſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I conſidered in mine heart.</hi> Heb. is, <hi>I ſet to my heart.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is a ſetting the heart to a thing, or upon a thing, as a Bee ſits upon a flower, and ſets her ſtrength to it to draw out the ſweet in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's about things to be done, or not to be done. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatio</hi> looks upon things as the eye upon the object. <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi>
                        <pb n="522" facs="tcp:61577:266"/> diſcerneth things whether good or bad, right or wrong, and there leaves them, having pronounced them ſo. Meditation is a further inquiſition into truth, or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of truth, and comes up neereſt to conſideration, which is in order to doing or not doing. Men intend this &amp; that, and oft fall upon things raſhly to their prejudice, becauſe they conſider not; now conſideration reflects upon things intended. The two ſons in the Goſpel, one ſaid, <hi>I will goe, and went not;</hi> the other ſaid, <hi>I will not goe, and went.</hi> The one's purpoſe was to goe, the other's not to goe: but this laſt conſidering of his ſinfull purpoſe, intention, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, repented, and went, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. It's taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing, or not doing, as you may ſee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.17. <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.14.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Furthering or impeding the execution of them, as it's ſees cauſe. Pſ. 119.59. <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies. David</hi> conſidered his wayes, and not finding them good, he ceas'd from walking any longer in them: and ſeeing Gods wayes the only good ways, he turnd about, ſtept into, and walked in them. If upon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion things be found good, the heart affects them, and ſo proceeds to the doing of them. The vertuous wife conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a field, and bought it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.16. But if things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſideration be found ſinfull, the heart diſaffects them, and ſo keeps off, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. of this Chap. <hi>He conſiders, and turns away from all his tranſgreſſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wherein the ſtrength of it lyeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In ſearching out the cauſes, effects, riſing, progreſſe, continuance, and iſſue of a thing, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.30. The Levites Concubine being cut in 12. pieces, &amp; ſent into all the coaſts of Iſrael; they ſaw it, &amp; ſaid, conſider of it, take advice, and ſpeak: let us ſearch out the cauſe and originall of this evill, what dammage it hath brought to the Jewiſh Religion, and may bring; what the Levite can ſay, what will be the iſſue of this horrible fact.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In comparing things together, and ſo drawing up and out that which may be moſt uſefull: when all things are laid
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:61577:266"/> together, weigh'd, ſcan'd over again and again; a man takes that is moſt neceſſary, ſeaſonable, ſutable and uſefull, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.10. <hi>The preacher ſought to find out acceptable words.</hi> Hee compared one word with another, one truth with another; and then in the 13. <hi>v. Let us heare the concluſion of the whole matter, feare God, &amp;c.</hi> He had tryed books, creatures, all things: and then conſidering them, ſums up, and draws out what was moſt materiall.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In preſſing to, and aſſiſting the ſoule in acting: when conſideration hath drawn up what is to be done, or not to be done, then it puts it upon the conſcience as ſinfull, if not followed, and directs in the execution. Many things wel contriv'd have miſcarryed through want of conſideration, which looks to the congruency of particulars to the whole, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.9. <hi>All men ſhall feare, and declare the work of God, for they ſhall wiſely conſider of his doings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſideration layes an injunction upon mens wills and conſciences to be doing; did men in theſe dayes wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Lords doings, they would feare and declare the work of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The excellency of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It's that God himſelfe doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Doth not hee that pondereth the heart conſider?</hi> When God intended to make man, he cal'd a Councell, <hi>Come, let us make man after our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> Gen. 1.26. The Lord conſiders, ponders, and weighs things according to the language of Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26, 27. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8, 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It differenceth a man from bruits; they are led by ſenſe, and cannot diſtinguiſh whether an action ought to be done or not, this is mans priviledge and power. Reaſon doth diſtinguiſh men from beaſts, but the generality of men do not uſe reaſon, they have ſoules for ſalt, their eyes, eares, taſts, their ſenſes are their guides. Jer. 10.14. <hi>Every man is bruitiſh in his knowledge.</hi> Men do not reflect upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſider them; if they did, they would not be ſo ſenſuall, ſo ſinfull. Iſa. 1.3. <hi>The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters Cribb: but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="524" facs="tcp:61577:267"/>3. It inables the underſtanding, compleats a man, makes him wiſe and prudentiall. Prov. 17.27. <hi>He that hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſpareth his words, and a man of underſtanding is of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit.</hi> He conſiders what advantage may be made of words, and therefore is ſparing in ſpeaking, ſhews the more underſtanding and excellency of ſpirit. Pro. 6.6. <hi>Conſider her wayes and be wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the conſidering of an Ants wayes will make us wiſe, much more the conſideration of our own ways. Direct acts may inable and perfect others, but reflect acts do inable and perfect a mans ſelfe. Conſideration looks inward, looks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame thing again and again, it defecates the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man from thoſe raw and imperfect notions and conceptions which ariſe at firſt, &amp; thoſe impertinent ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe afterwards. We ſay, ſecond thoughts are beſt, which implies that conſideration, ripens and perfects the man and his actions; as meate in the Pot, if ſuddenly pul'd out, is raw, but if well boil'd, is freed from crude hamors, and ſo more wholſom.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It puts life into thoſe principles and talents God hath given a man; like a Drumme in an Army, when that beats, all ſtir and march; like a ſpring in a watch, when that goes all the wheels goe. Did men conſider what graces and gifts God hath given them, they would not let them lie ſtill and fallow, but improve them. Iſa. 64.7. <hi>None ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to take hold on thee.</hi> They had talents, but did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them. Heb 10.24. <hi>Let us conſider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works.</hi> Conſideration will ſet others graces on work, and much more a mans own.</p>
                     <p>A third thing here commended about this ſon of a wicked father, is his <hi>doing the contrary:</hi> he worſhips God in his own way, he eats not upon the mountains, he lifts not up his eyes to Idols; but he comes to <hi>Mount-Sion,</hi> and lifts up his eyes to the God of heaven whom he ſerves; he is chaſt &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, he wrongs none, but doth good to all according to his ability: he executes judgment, and walks in Gods ways; and what ever his fathers ſins have been, though crimſon and ſcarlet abominations, he ſhall not die for them, but he ſhall ſurely live.</p>

Some good thing towards the God of Iſrael was found in a ſon of <hi>Jeroboam's,</hi> who made Iſrael to ſin, 1 <hi>K.</hi> 14.13.</p>
                     <p>Some untoward parents in our dayes have had good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſuch as have much honoured God. Now this is
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:61577:268"/> not from nature, or becauſe they are born under ſuch and ſuch planets, but becauſe they are born of God, and made partakers of the divine nature. If parents have gracious children, let them give the glory thereof to God, whoſe grace hath made them ſuch: If they have ungracious ones, let them begge hard of God for mercy and grace for them, who hath abundance of the ſpirit to beſtow on whom he pleaſe, and hath promiſed to thoſe in Covenant with him, to powr out his ſpirit upon their ſeed, and his bleſſing upon their off-ſpring, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's not alwayes ſafe, warrantable, to imitate Parents, Anceſtors, Predeceſſors, and to tread in their ſteps; it may be dangerous, deadly, yea damnable. If the ſon of the unjuſt man ſhould follow his father in his ways, he muſt dye for it; but if he ſee his wayes, and doth not ſuch like, he ſhall live. When the wayes of Parents are idolatrous, ſuperſtitious, prophane, oppreſſive, contrary to, or not grounded upon the word of God, children are not to conform unto them. There is one greater then they, and wiſer then they, who is the father of ſpirits, and hath more authority over them then their Parents after the fleſh, him muſt they hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, his counſels muſt they embrace, his commands muſt they obey, his will muſt they doe. The Lord commends the ſon here that doth contrary to his wicked father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, <hi>Men are redeemed from the vaine converſation by tradition from their fathers.</hi> Fathers are vain, have vain converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deliver thoſe to their children, but children ſhould not receive their traditions, nor imitate their converſations; they are redeem'd from them, but they are apt to do it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.14:44.17.

There is a full prohibition againſt it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Be not yee like your fathers, and like your brethren which treſpaſſed againſt the Lord God of your fathers, who therefore gave them up to deſolation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Conſideration is a ſpeciall meanes to keepe men from ſinning; if a ſon ſee his fathers ſins, and conſidereth, and
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:61577:268"/> doth not ſuch like. There is a ſtrong inclination in men to ſin, Example is powerfull to draw out that inclination, and eſpecially the example of a Father; yet conſideration hath vertue in it to ſtop that inclination, to take off from evill example, and to cary another way: The <hi>Prodigall</hi> when he came to himſelfe, that is, conſidered what he had done, in what caſe he was, what might be had in his fathers houſe, he comes off from his wicked wayes, and returns to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17. It is want of conſideration that men ſinne ſo as they doe: had <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter,</hi> others well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they would not have fallen into ſuch ſins as they did; it's raſhneſſe, inconſiderateneſſe that occaſions and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth many ſins. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but conſidereſt not the beame that is in thine owne eye?</hi> Want of conſideration makes men cenſorious and hypocriticall, it leads men into a multitude of ſinfull wayes, and keepes them there, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.19. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Ecceſ.</hi> 5.1. Whereas if men would ſeriouſly conſider, they would neither ſin ſo frequently, nor continue in ſin, if over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with it. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.3. <hi>It may be they will conſider though they be a rebellious houſe.</hi> Here the Lord intimates, that if they would conſider, they would give over their ſinfull practiſes, and not perſiſt in wayes to provoke God: They would ſee ſo much evill in their owne wayes, ſo much equity in Gods wayes, that they would leave the one, and embrace the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>In the 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> of this Chap. you may ſee the vertue and efficacy of Conſideration: <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth, and turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all his tranſgreſſions.</hi> Nothing more advantages Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's kingdom then incogitancy and inconſiderateneſſe; &amp; nothing doth prejudice it more then the contrary. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration puts a ſtop to mens ſinfull ways, and cauſeth them to turn to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59.

                     <p>Erroneous and corrupt opinions being entertained, are not eaſily got out of the heads and hearts of men; theſe Jewes had drunk in an hard opinion of God, that hee dealt unjuſtly with them, puniſhing them for their fathers ſinnes; the Lord by many arguments and inſtances clears up the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity of his proceedings with the ſons of men, that hee puniſht none without juſt cauſe, and that it is for their own ſin when he doth it; hee ſpends 18. <hi>verſes</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the falſhood and evill of their tenet, to remove it out of them; but they, notwithſtanding all this, hold their opinion faſt, and diſpute it with God: <hi>Yet ſay yee, why? doth not the ſonne beare the iniquity of the father?</hi> We are of this mind and judgement, and ſo ſhall continue for ought thou haſt ſaid. Errors quickly root deep, take ſtrong hold, and cannot eaſily be pul'd up.</p>
                     <p>The Phariſees held corrupt opinions about workings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.2. diſpencing with childrens obedience to parents, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.11. about ſwearing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.16.18. faſting and tithing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.12. They held many corrupt opinions touching the law, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. appears, and could Chriſt prevaile with them to get thoſe opinions out of them? hee brought the cleareſt light that ever was, yet they loved their owne darkneſſe more then his light; yea they gate him out
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:61577:271"/> of the world, before he could get theſe errours out of them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sadduces</hi> denyed the Reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.23. And notwithſtanding Chriſt took pains to convince them, and ſpake to the aſtoniſhment of others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. yet their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion abode with them, and they were of that minde after Chriſt was gone to glory, even in <hi>Paul's</hi> dayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. <hi>Hymenaeus, Alexander, Philetus,</hi> had rather be delivered up to Satan, then deliver up their corrupt and damnable opinion, of ſaying the reſurrection is paſt already, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. The Apoſtles had taken up an opinion that Chriſt would be great in the world, and advance them, from which opinion Chriſt had oft been beating them off, yet it abode with them till his aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. There were thoſe in the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> who held corrupt doctrines, and the Angel of it could not get them out, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15. Take heed therefore what opinions you receive. If in <hi>John's</hi> time there was need to try the ſpirits, becauſe many falſe Prophets were gone out into the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. much more had men now need to try the ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the world is full of falſe Prophets and falſe ſpirits; and men are grown ſo artificiall to deceive, that if it were poſſible the very Elect ſhould be deceived, and that finally. Let the Apoſtles counſell take place, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all things:</hi> Take nothing upon truſt for the learning, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, worth of, or reſpect you have to any man; but prove all by the word, ſee it have a ſound bottoming there, and then it's good; hold it faſt, then it will do you good, let it not goe.</p>

Prov. 19.3. <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord:</hi> But what cauſe hath he to fret againſt God, correcting and puniſhing him for his folly? men ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the puniſhment of their iniquity, as it's <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. rather then complain, when it's their own fault that they ſuffer; yea men have cauſe to be thankful to God that he doth puniſh them leſſe then their iniquities deſerve.</p>

                  <p>HAving laid downe the caſe of a wicked man, repenting him of, and turning him from his ſins, and ſo cleared the proceedings of God, that ſuch an one finds mercy, and ſuffers not for his owne ſin, much leſſe for his Fathers, he comes here to the uſe of a righteous man, who if he turne from his righteouſneſſe, and fall to wicked courſes, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer righteouſneſſe ſhall not advantage him, but he ſhall be dealt with according to his preſent ſin. The ſin of the wicked repenting ſhall not hinder him from mercy, and eternall life; and the righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhall not keepe him from juſtice, and eternall death. Old ſins ſhall not burthen a returning ſinner, and old righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe will not help a revolting Saint.</p>
                  <p>Of a righteous man, his turning from his righteouſneſſe, and commiting iniquity, hath been largly ſpoken of, Chap. 3.20. where the firſt part of this Verſe is word for word; yet becauſe this Verſe is much controverted, and inſiſted upon by the Patrons of Apoſtacy and falling away; I ſhall touch upon it.</p>
                  <pb n="542" facs="tcp:61577:276"/>
                  <p>Who the righteous or juſt man here ſpoken of is, may be gathered from the oppoſition to the wicked man, the one is really wicked, and the other is really righteous; that is, with a legall, or morall righteouſneſſe. He hath <hi>not eaten upon the Mountaines, lift up his eyes to Idolls, defiled his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wife, oppreſſed the poore and needy, but given his bread to the hungry, cloatqed the naked, taken no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury nor increaſe, that hath executed judgement, and walked in Gods Statutes,</hi> ſuch a one is righteous, and the righteous man in the Text.</p>
                  <p>That here is meant a morall, legall righteouſneſſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from thoſe words in the 4. and 20. Verſes, where it's ſaid, <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth it ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll die,</hi> if this did refer to the Goſpell, and righteouſneſſe thereof, and not to the Law, and legall righteouſneſſe, no man could be ſaved, becauſe all men ſin, but notwithſtanding their ſinning, thoſe are righteous with the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell, they ſhall not dye, but be ſaved: it muſt therefore be underſtood of a legall, civill, morall righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gerhard</hi> brings this Verſe to prove, that a man by his ſins may, <hi>Excutere fidem &amp; ſpiritum ſanctum.</hi> loco. Theol: T. 4. <hi>De bonis operibus. Bellarmin</hi> brings it, Tom. 4. l. 5. <hi>de grat: &amp; lib. arb.</hi> c. 29. to prove that a man may, <hi>Exuere cor novum:</hi> And Lib. 3. <hi>de juſtif:</hi> c. 14. he makes uſe of this Verſe to ſhew that faith may be loſt. <hi>Quid clarius? quomodo quaeſo avertitur juſtus a juſtitia ſi fide ſola juſtificatur, &amp; fides ſemel concepta extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui non poteſt.</hi>

                  <p>For Anſwer unto theſe, know,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's ſaid when the righteous man doth turne away, he ſhall be ſo dealt with, as if he had never been righteous. It's a caution to prevent a righteous mans falling, rather then an implication that he will, or ſhall turne from his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Prophet ſpeaks here of a righteous man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in himſelfe, not in relation to God, or Chriſt, and ſo he may turne from his righteouſneſſe, as Angells, and <hi>Adam</hi> did.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="543" facs="tcp:61577:276"/>3. The ſcope of the Chapter is, not to prove falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from grace, but to cleare the Lords juſtice, and that in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he doth not puniſh one man for the ſin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he be unguilty thereof: A guiltleſſe Son ſhall not ſuffer for the ſins of a guilty Father, Verſ. 4.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he is not partiall in his dealings, either with the wicked, or righteous, he puniſhes wicked men if they ſin, he ſpares them if they repent: and as for righteous men, he bleſſes, proſpers them, becauſe they walk in his Statutes, keep his judgements, and deale truely; but if they forſake their righteouſneſſe, and fall to ſinfull courſes, he will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them as he doth wicked men: ſo that here is not any thing ſpoken of grace, or faith, whereby men are united to Chriſt, juſtified, ſanctified, and evidenced to be in Covenant with God, through Chriſt; but what is here ſaid, is ſpoken in a legall way, namely to vindicate God from what unjuſtly they caſt upon him, <hi>Viz. That they ſuffered for the ſins of others. Jer.</hi> 31.29, 30, 31. <hi>In thoſe dayes they ſhall ſay no more, the Fathers have eaten a ſowre grape, &amp;c. but every one ſhall die for his owne iniquity. Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> God is now put upon better termes with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then he was at that time. If they ſinned, they ſhould die, if they did well, they ſhould live, this was the Covenant of works; but God promiſed to make a Covenant of grace with them, which they ſhould not breake as they had done the former, Ver. 32. for he will put his feare into their hearts, that they ſhould not depart from him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.40. and his Spirit, which ſhould cauſe them to walk in his Statutes, to keep his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to doe them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. And Chriſt tells his Diſciples, that he would ſend the Comforter that he might abide with them for ever, that he might dwell with them, and be in them. <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is borne of God doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is borne of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.9. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, then ſurely not ſo ſin as to ſhake off faith, thruſt out the Spirit, totally and finally to fall away. This laſt place
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:61577:277"/> troubleth all thoſe who hold that opinion of falling away. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Variae ſune hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus loci, qui e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam eſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillimus, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiones.</note> that this place is the hardeſt of all to anſwer. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> refers it to the State of glory, in his Commentary upon <hi>Iſaiah. Bernard,</hi> by ſeed underſtands <hi>Gratiam praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis,</hi> and ſayth, the predeſtinate cannot ſin ſo as to harme them, ſeeing their ſins are forgiven, and to work for their good.

Some that ſay, ſaving faith may be loſt, doe make three degrees of ſaving faith.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, and higheſt degree is, the attainment of the life, and Divine nature of Chriſt into our ſouls, after which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment we live ſtill by faith carrying us out after the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of this new life, and nature begotten in us, which are the Heavenly ſatisfactions of God, and Chriſt; from this faith it's acknowledged impoſſible to fall away.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond, or middle degree of ſaving faith, is ſuch a belief of Chriſts fullneſſe, life, and Divine communications, as bring us not onely to fall in love with Chriſt, and thoſe communications in him, of life, and Divine things, but alſo cauſeth us to leave all things in our deſires, and affections, wholly to depend on God, and to wait with earneſtnes, longing, and patience, for the giving in of Chriſt, his life, and Divine communications; and though ſuch a degree of faith, doth not likely fall away, yet it's poſſible it may, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Caſt not away your confidence,</hi> which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates they might doe it.</p>
                  <p>A third, and the loweſt degree of true ſaving faith, is that which believes the ſatisfaction, and fullneſſe of Chriſt to be for us, and ſo affects us therewith, that it carries us out after

This is true faith, and will make us partakers of Chriſt if continued. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. from this faith it's affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that we may fall for ever. <hi>John</hi> 8.31.32. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 1.23. there is mention of true, ſaving faith, for it would ſave them if continued in, and this manner of Speech ſhews, they might not continue, and ſo looſe what they had.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. I find not Salvation put upon the ſtrength, but truth of faith, not upon the higheſt degrees, but any degree of faith. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Marke</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.13.39.16.31. It's not ſaid in theſe or other places, if you have ſuch a degree of faith, you ſhall be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaved; but ſimply, beleiving is required, the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true faith will doe it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth, the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleive in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The Theife upon the Croſſe had not attained to ſuch high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of faith, he by one act, and that of a weake faith was juſtified, and ſaved. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.42, 43.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The power of God is in the weakeſt faith, as well as in the ſtrongeſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith, unto Salvation.</hi> It's not through ſtrong faith, or ſuch a degree of faith, but onely, through faith; the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God begets faith in the ſoule, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. It keeps it alive there, how weake ſoever it be, and it keeps it unto Salvation; that we may be ſaved by faith, he ſaves faith in us, he will not let faith periſh, that we may not periſh: Gods power muſt faile, if true faith in the loweſt degree faile. But, <hi>John</hi> 10.29.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If men may fall from true, ſaving faith, being in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, what hinders but they may fall from it, being growne up, and come to mans eſtate? <hi>Gradus non variat naturam,</hi> death which ſeizeth upon infants, ſeizeth alſo upon men; water which extinguiſheth a ſpark, will extinguiſh alſo a great fire. The ſence, and operations of faith men may be without, but the ſubſtance of it abides; all the fiery darts
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61577:278"/> of the Devill, cannot pierce the ſhield of faith. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. All the ſtrength, malice, and oppoſition of the World, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overcome a little true faith. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>One borne of God,</hi> though but new borne, a very babe, <hi>he overcomes the World, he is borne, not of corruptible, but incorruptible ſeed.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>He hath an annointing abides in him.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>His faith hath made him a Son of God. Gal</hi> 3.26. And <hi>Sons abide in the Houſe for ever. John</hi> 8.35. Yea, <hi>he that beleives hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation. John</hi> 5.24. God <hi>puts his feare into his heart, and he ſhall not depart from him. Jer.</hi> 32.40. His Spirit being in the heart of a true beleiver, cauſes him to <hi>Walke in Gods Statutes, to keepe his judgements, and doe them, he ſhall be confirmed to the end.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. So that by theſe Texts it appears, that where true, ſaving faith, is, it will abide, not be extinct, but will live for ever.</p>
                  <p>Be it granted therefore, that in the places mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 8.31, 32. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 1.23. A true ſaving faith is meant, then the words, <hi>if ye continue,</hi> doe not, import they ſhould not continue. If, is not <hi>Vox dubitationis,</hi> but <hi>Cautionis,</hi> not a word of doubting, and diſparagement, but of caution, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, ſo it's taken, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>If you doe theſe things you ſhall never fall away.</hi> This and the like places are incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtir them up unto perſeverance, and doe ſhew, that none have true ſaving faith, are intrinſically, and really in Chriſt, but thoſe doe continue in the word and faith, to the end.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe they doe continue and not fall from their faith, yet doth not this word, <hi>If,</hi> note a poſſibility, that they may fall from their faith? Conditionall ſuppoſitions are of things impoſſible, as well as of poſſibles. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we, or an Angell from Heaven, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 24.24. <hi>If it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould ſeduce the very Elect.</hi> But they cannot be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and thoſe that have true faith cannot fall away finally. <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath cleane hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger. John</hi> 2. Epiſt.

                     <p>There be ſome things which men catch at to make the wayes of God ſeem unequall, eſpecially theſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. For his puniſhments; great was the complaint and charge here in this Chap. that God did puniſh them for their fathers ſins, to which calumny ſufficient hath been ſpoken: That of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſinne, and all his poſterity to ſuffer for it, ſticks much with ſome; that millions ſhould periſh upon that account, makes the way of God ſeem unequall. But upon due conſideration it will appear otherwiſe; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> being a publique perſon, repreſented all mankind: and God covenanted with him, that if he ſtood and kept that image of God in which he was created, that then his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be like him, and happy with himſelfe: but if hee fell that they ſhould ſuffer in him, and with him, and what unequalneſſe was here? <hi>Adam</hi> was the root of all men, had all in his loins, and as all loſt the image of God in him fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.16, 17, 18, 19. So all ſhould have had the image of God in him ſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For his choiſes; God ſeems to reſpect perſons, becauſe he dealeth unequally with men that are equall, all men are fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> equally guilty; yet ſome of theſe God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to life, others he leaves and paſſes by, all are his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and he deales not alike with them. Beſides, he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the fooliſh, the weak, the baſe and deſpiſed, and ſets by the wiſe, mighty and noble, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. what equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:61577:283"/> therefore in his wayes? Yea oft times he takes great noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners, and thoſe are leſſe ſinfull are rejected.</p>
                     <p>To ſet all ſtraight here, conſider what it is to accept or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perſons. It is to look at men upon externall grounds, ſome outward qualities, and thereupon to do for them, as riches, honour, birth, breeding, power, kindred, family, beauty, ſtrength, condition of life, learning, wiſdom, parts, policie, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now the Lord doth not look at any externall adjuncts or ornaments in his Elections and Choices of men: nothing in the creature or from the creature moves him, it is his owne good pleaſure and will ſets him a work to chuſe any, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, know God is not bound to deal equally with men, being equally miſerable, for then he muſt deſtroy all, or ſave all, and ſo have the glory of juſtice alone, or mercy, alone, and not the glory of both, then he ſhould not have made Chriſt ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. But have puniſhed <hi>Adam</hi> and all thoſe ſin'd in him; and what then had become of the world? hell had been full, and heaven empty. And for his choiſe of any out of thoſe are equall in ſin, or of greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what doth this ſhew but the freedome of his grace, and his ſoveraignty over the creatures, to doe with them as hee pleaſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. Shall that priviledg be denyed to God which is given to the Potter, and Gods way ſeeme more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall in his dealing with men, then the potters is with the clay? And whereas God doth take the weak, baſe, fooliſh and deſpiſed things of the world, it's argument that he doth not reſpect perſons; he takes thoſe have nothing in them to move him: Should he take the wiſe, mighty, noble, rich &amp; learned, then there would be ſome bottom for charging God with acceptation of perſons; but examine the Scriptures, and they quit the Lord abundantly from it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Job</hi> 34.19. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. In all theſe places the Lord is freed from regarding, reſpecting, or accepting of perſons.</p>

                        <pb n="557" facs="tcp:61577:283"/>3. For his diſtribution of things, the Lord, is accounted to deale unequally; why, ſay men of this humour, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo much, and others ſo little, or nothing at all? ſome have Mannors, Lordſhips, Counties, Kingdoms, when others have neither houſe nor land; ſome have five Talents, others one; ſome are wiſe, and others ideots; yea that which ſhews the way of the Lord to be unequall, is, wicked men have great eſtates, high places, they ride, and the righteous goe on foot being poor and low.</p>
                     <p>For anſw. to this, know, that the Lord is a free agent, and may give what he pleaſes, when, where, and in what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems good to himſelfe, and to his infinite wiſdome. Men blame not providence, that ſome trees are ſtronger, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, bigger then others: If the Vine, Olive, and Fig-tree be lower then Cedars and Oaks, they are more fruitfull, and yeeld pleaſanter fruit. Is the Merchant blameable if hee fraught one ſhip with Coals, another with Corn, one with skins, another with ſilks, one with boards, another with the richeſt wines? Surely no; and may not the Lord put into theſe earthen Veſſels of men what he will, and as much as he will? If he make women the weaker veſſels, deny beards to them, which he hath given to men, is he unequall in ſuch diſpenſations? what if wicked men have much? it's but <hi>thick clay,</hi> Hab. 2.6. <hi>Meat that periſheth,</hi> John 6.27. <hi>

If the race be to the ſlow, the battle to the weak, bread to the fooliſh, riches and favour to the ignorant and unskilfull; what equity is there in Gods wayes, and why ſhould we having talents uſe them, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them be diſappointed?</p>
                     <p>This Object. ſeems to ſtrike deep, yet wounds not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Lord, and equity of his wayes. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Gods wayes are not unequall, becauſe we cannot ſee the reaſon of them, we are poor pur-blind creatures, and know little: The Lords underſtanding is infinite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. There is no ſearching of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.28. His judgements are a great deep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. There is no fathoming of them, <hi>his wayes are paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11.33. It's not ſafe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe wee ſee not the equity of them, to conclude they are unequall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God diſappoints men of abilities uſing lawful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means to attain their ends propounded, becauſe they truſt in the means, idolize them, looking at God in the ſecond place, or not at all; acquaint your ſelves with theſe places, and you will find the reality of it, that men are apt to confide in their own abilities, to truſt in an arme of fleſh, to applaud their own preparations, and expect much from them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1, 2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7.49.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.13. If God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint them for their own ſin, of their expectation, what inequality is therein Gods wayes? <hi>the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> death of deſigns and undertakings, as well as of men the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let it be granted, that men uſe their abilities &amp; means conducing to their ends propounded, the right way, without confidence in the ſame, in ſubordination unto God, yet may the Lord diſappoint mens purpoſes, contrivances, aimes and
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:61577:284"/> ends, and that without ſin; for the Lord is above all ſecond cauſes, his providence rules and runs through all, and doth give check when, where, and how it pleaſes to all creature motions; and God will have men to fee, that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his providence &amp; aſſiſtance nothing can be done; it's not humane diſpoſitions, counſels, preparations, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, uſe of any medicines that can produce any effect without God. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.37. <hi>Who is hee that ſaith, and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> Let Princes, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, and Powers, conſult of, attempt what they will, if the Lord have not commanded the thing, if he do not co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with them in doing the thing, it proves abortive. 1 <hi>K.</hi> 12.21, 22, 23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.33, 34 36. 2 <hi>K.</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Job</hi> 5.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9, 10.

God ſhould not be om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, nor reign in the Kingdoms of the Earth, if men could carry on their deſigns, and attain their ends without him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Events and ſucceſſes of things are hidden in the hand of God, men muſt therefore improve their talents, uſe all lawfull meanes for accompliſhing thoſe things are good in the ſight of God, and wait upon the Lord for diſcovery of his mind and good pleaſure therein. It argues an ill ſpirit to ſay we ſhall be diſappointed, and therefore we will ſit ſtill; how know we what ſhall be the iſſue of any undertaking? If one enterprize faile, another may take; if one arrow hit not the mark, a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> or 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> may: If we hide our talents in nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, wee ſhall be found ill ſervants, and the command is, <hi>what ever thy hand findeth to doe, doe it with thy might,</hi> Eccl. 9.10. Men muſt not be idle, but active, and active to they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.: For, <hi>there is a ſeaſon to every thing, and a time to every purpoſe,</hi> Chap. 3.1. What that ſeaſon and time will prove, no man knows, you muſt venture therefore. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.6. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeede, and in the evening with-hold not thy

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. If there be diſappointments, God may make them as advantagious to thee as enjoyments, or recompence it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother undertaking. <hi>Amaziah</hi> hired 100000. mighty men of valour out of Iſrael for 100. talents of ſilver, God ſends a Prophet, who bids him diſmiſſe them all; this diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment troubled him, what ſhall we doe for the 100. talents? the Prophet anſwered him, the Lord is able to give thee much more then this, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. So God is able to make up any diſappointment, and more too: what unequity or iniquity then is in his way?</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p>The ground that Papiſts, <hi>Arminians,</hi> and others, goe upon, is, that Commands ſuppoſe power in men to doe what is Commanded.</p>
                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:61577:292"/>
                     <p>This ground is too weake to build their ſtructure upon. For what man ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall had power to keep the Law exactly, yet the Law conſiſts of Commands, had men been able to have done it, the Law would have ſaved them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>What the Law could not doe in that it was weake through the fleſh, God ſending, &amp;c. Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſſe ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> Why could not the Law give life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man had not power, ſtrength to keep it; God may Command that which men have not power to doe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To breake the ſtrength of mans confidence; Men through apprehenſion of their abilities ſtand much upon doing, and think they can performe much: What ſhall I doe to be ſaved? God may Command that now which is beyond mans ſtrength, that ſo he may know his owne weakneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To cauſe us to ſue to him for help to doe what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> Commanded the wiſe men to tell him his Dreame, which was impoſſible, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſought to God for the diſcovery of the thing, and obtained it. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.17, 18, 19. God Commands what we cannot doe, that we may know what to ask; if any thing be hard, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let us not ſtick in our ſelves, but run to God, ſaith <hi>Leo, Qui ideo dat praeceptum ut excitet deſiderium &amp; praeſtet auxilium.</hi> Aug. Ep. 24. <hi>Da quod ibes &amp; jube quod velis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Lord may doe it becauſe he can give what he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.4. God bids <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Prophecy, he could not doe it unleſſe God gave him the Spirit of Prophecy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the next Verſe it's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord fell upon him.</hi> Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Lazarus; Come forth, John</hi> 11.43. he had no power to doe it, but he Commanded, accompanied his word with power: And <hi>John</hi> 5.25. <hi>The howre is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and now is, that the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Son of God, and they that heare ſhall live.</hi>

                     <p>The meaning then of theſe words, <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new Spirit,</hi> is, be not negligent and wanting to your ſelves, but uſe the means appointed of God, give dilligence to obtaine a change of your hearts and Spirits, to get Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and bring forth fruit worthy thereof. <hi>Caſtal.</hi>

                     <p>That repentance is profitable to man, and pleaſing to God, <hi>repent and turne, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine, why will you die?</hi> I have no pleaſure in your death, but I have pleaſure in your repentance and life. When man hath undone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, repentance is his ſetting up againe; it's ſafe landing after Shipwrack: the Prodigall repenting and turning, did advantage himſelfe, and pleaſe his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all periſh.</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3.5. Repentance preſerves from deſtruction, and hath that good in it. See <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. And that it greatly pleaſes God. The Parable of the loſt ſheep ſheweth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7. <hi>There is more joy in Heaven for the repentance of one ſinner, then for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of</hi> 99. <hi>juſt perſons.</hi> Sacrifices under the Law were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God; a repentant broken heart is inſtead of all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. God will not, he cannot <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it, he will <hi>looke to it, Iſa.</hi> 66.2. he will <hi>dwell in it, Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sin is of a ruining nature, <hi>ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi> Sin in it ſelfe is deſtructive, what is ſaid of time, it's <hi>Edax rerum,</hi> a conſumer of all things, is verified of ſin, nay, more then time could doe, ſin hath done: time could never have ruin'd Angells, ſin did it, ſin threw them out of Heaven,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:61577:293"/> 
                        <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, ſin ruined the Old World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.7. it ruin'd <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Gen.</hi> 19.13. The cry of their ſins was great, and therefore the Angells deſtroyed it. Wars are ruining and deſolating things, ſo is the plague, and famine; but ſin brings them all, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.13.17.19. and is more ruinating then they all. Sin ruines the <hi>name, Prov.</hi> 6.33. it ruins the <hi>Conſcience and comforts of it, Pſal.</hi> 32.3.51.8. It ruins the <hi>Soule,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. Theſe things, the name, Conſcience, comforts, ſoule, ſword, famine, plague, cannot reach; they may, and doe oft ruine our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, our fleſh, our lives, but further they goe not, ſin ruins both theſe and the other. Sin is wonderfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, and proves deſtructive to them that deale with it. <hi>Gideons</hi> Ephod was a ſnare to him and to his Houſe, <hi>Lemokeſh,</hi> it ruin'd him, and his, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.27. it was their ſin which laid waſt the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which brought the ſlaughtering Angells, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. and kindled the fire in the Temple, and Citty, and laid all waſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That man who in truth comes unto God, muſt come off from all ſin, he muſt not ſtick in any. <hi>Repent and turne from all your tranſgreſſions.</hi> Caſt away all your tranſgreſſions, you muſt not like any, but loath all, not keep any, but caſt out all; if you caſt out a thouſand, and reteine but one, it's no ſound comming to God, no true repentance, or turning. <hi>Herod</hi> turn'd from many evills, but would not turn from his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias, Marke</hi> 6.18, 19, 20. and all his turning was nothing. <hi>Judas</hi> his life was faire as the other Apoſtles, no viſible ſin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, onely he had a covetous heart within, and becauſe that golden Devill was not caſt out, he was caſt into Hell; his Apoſtleſhip, Preaching, working of Miracles, hearing of Chriſt converſing with him did him no good. Let men goe as far as they will in repentance, turning from, and caſting off of ſin, if it be not from all, it's from none; for if any one ſin be kept and lived in, the Union betweene ſin and the ſoule is not diſſolved, and ſo there is no true hatred, no reall ejection of ſin. If a man did hate ſin, and caſt it out becauſe it's ſin, he would doe ſo by all ſin, becauſe there is the ſame reaſon for all as for one, and for one, as for all. Let us look
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:61577:294" rendition="simple:additions"/> narrowly to it, that we doe not harbour, nor ſpare any ſin in our boſomes. <hi>Saul</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> whom he ſhould have deſtroyed, and they were his ruine.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That for the incouragement of men to uſe the means, and wait upon God in them, he honours them with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which is his prerogative and peculiar work. <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new Spirit, turne your ſelves.</hi> Theſe be acts which none but the Lord can doe. A new heart, a new Spirit is, <hi>Opus divinae gratiae.</hi> becauſe there is <hi>Aliquis ab homine Conatus,</hi> therefore he is ſaid to doe that, <hi>Quod precipue divinae gratiae virtus operatur:</hi> Sanct. in Locum. This is very faire for a Jeſuite, but the Apoſtle goeth further, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>The will and the deed are of the Lord.</hi> Let us be incouraged therefore to be dilligent in the uſe of all means, and that conſtantly; there may be a new heart, and a new Spirit given in from God, his mighty power put forth to work theſe, and yet be attributed to us, that we have made our ſelves new hearts, and new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

I fear we have Lyons among us, for whom we may juſtly take up a lamentation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That thoſe Princes do oppreſs their people, and ruine their Kingdoms, are ingratefull and unnaturall, for their People and Kingdoms are their Mothers: <hi>what is thy mother? Jeruſalem, Judaea</hi> is thy mother; it's the people chooſes them, and ſo brings them forth, ſets them up. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.30. <hi>The people of the land tooke Jehoahaz the ſonne of Joſiah, and annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and made him King in his Fathers ſtead:</hi> How wickedly did he therefore to become a Lyon to this people who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd him; if he were unnaturall, who ript up the bowels of his own Mother, ſo likewiſe is hee that rips and rends the bowels of that Kingdom begate him. Princes ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them well who have given them their Princely being; They have their milke and maintenance from them, and it's height of ingratitude to wrong or ruine them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such as the people be, uſually ſuch are the Rulers, the Princes: If the Mother be a Lioneſſe, the Whelps will be Lyons; if the Lioneſſe be audacious, bloody, libidinous, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous, the Lyons wil be ſuch. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her Princes likewiſe, the Princes were like the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.4. <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me.</hi> The
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:61577:299"/> people ſet up <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> and he was a Lyon, he did wickedly, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.32.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Great is the efficacie of evill example, it prevails more then good example. <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> had a godly parent, <hi>Joſiah</hi> by name, of whom it's ſaid, that <hi>there was no King like him before or after him, that turned to the Lord with all his ſoule, heart and might according to all the law of Moſes,</hi> 2 King. 23.25. Not the good education nor good example he had from and by his Father, did ſufficiently antidote him againſt the poyſon and power of evill example; he was brought up <hi>among lyons, and learnt of them to catch the prey.</hi> They were wicked, covetous, proud, fierce, ſubtle, cruell, revengefull, and their manners he took up, conform'd unto. Wickedneſſe is eaſily learn'd, men are ſo apt to it that they need no rods, ferulaes to put them on. Parents cannot propagate piety; if that could have been, <hi>Joſiah</hi> would have had ſonnes as eminent for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, as they were for impiety; gracious parents have graceleſſe children, let none be troubled thereat as a thing ſtrange, it was ſo with <hi>Joſiah.</hi> If you be godly, and would have your children ſo, take heed of being ill examples your ſelves, or letting them be amongſt thoſe who give ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plee; for tinder is not apter to take fire, waxe, the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeale, paper the ink, then youth is to receive the impreſſions of wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After good Princes and great Reformers, Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence orders it ſo, that wretched wicked Kings, enemies to all good are ſet up. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a moſt godly King, and more throughly reforming, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ver <hi>Judah</hi> had any before; yet after him comes a Lyon, a wicked <hi>Jehoahaz.</hi> When peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are unthankfull for good Princes and Rulers, when they murmur againſt Reformation, have a ſecret enmity, open bitterneſſe againſt godlineſſe, and thoſe are godly; it's juſt with God to ſet Lyons over them, to be terrible unto them, to eate up their eſtates and them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When wicked men come to places of eminency, they vent their corruptions lay hid before, they make progreſſe in wickedneſſe, nothing reſtrains them. When this <hi>whelp,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:61577:300"/> Jehoahaz</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>me to the Throne, he beame a young Lyon, a Lyon rampant, he could catch the prey, and devour men. We oft think that the whelps of great Ones are well natur'd, well educated, very hopefull, will prove admirable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods glory and publique good; but we deceive our ſelves: when they come to publique and high places, their lyoniſh natures do appear, and they grow worſe and worſe; they perfect wickedneſſe, nothing prevails to keep them in, but they muſt play the Lyons, flay the skins, ſuck the blood, eate the fleſh, and crack the bones. There was as great hope of <hi>Joſiah's</hi> ſons, as ever of any, yet you ſee how they prov'd. <hi>Nero</hi> at firſt for five yeares carryed himſelfe wel, like a lamb; but he was a Lyon, and his lyoniſh diſpoſition ſhewed it ſelf to the full. You are godly, and have hopefull iſſue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not too much unto your ſelves of them: great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſappointed, cauſe great vexations.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That Princes pervert the end for which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, and ſet up by men: God appointed not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, be they Princes or others, to <hi>lurk for the prey,</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour men,</hi> but to preſerve men: They ſhould be Shepheards, not Lyons, nurſing Fathers; not Canniballs, they ſhould govern them according to divine rule,<note place="margin">They ſhould be in <hi>utilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> not <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutionem ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorum.</hi>

                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. not after Prerogative, a devouring beaſt which eats up mens eſtates, honours, lives, they ſhould do Juſtice, not obſtruct or pervert it: But where be thoſe Princes that anſwer the end of their inſtitution, that lurk not for prey, that devoure not men? In <hi>Micah's</hi> dayes the heads of the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Princes of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> abhord judgment, and perverted all equity; they built up <hi>Sion</hi> with blood, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> with iniquity, and for their ſins and ſakes was <hi>Sion</hi> plouwed as a field, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made heaps. Take heed you are Governours of Families, that you pervert not that inſtitution; <hi>Ne ſis leo in domo tua,</hi> be not bitter to your Wives, beat not Servants for your phantaſies, oppreſſe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are under you, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 4.30.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The evill doings of Princes flye abroad; if they play the Lyons, roare, raven, teare, oppreſſe, the Nation wil hear
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:61577:300"/> of it. When <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> became a Lyon, catch'd the prey, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured men, <hi>the Nations alſo heard of him:</hi> not only his owne Nation knew it, but the Nations round about. Princes, great perſons ſtand high, their voyces are heard, and actions ſeen farr: Let them whiſper in ſecret, plot miſchiefe in their cloſets, out they come: Cabbinet-letters, Counſels, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, Treaſons, come abroad and ſpread far. Their projects how cryphically ſoever carryed, are obſerv'd, divulg'd, and fill the Nations with the noiſe thereof. Princes generally are ſo wicked, that they do <hi>male audire in omni gente.</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles and Nations are fill'd with the reports thereof; if they will doe infamous things, they cannot bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. When Princes prove Lyons, God ſtirs up ſome to hunt and take thoſe Lyons. The Nations hearing that <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> catch'd the prey, and devoured men, they bethought and beſtir'd themſelves, digg'd a pit, hunted this Lyon into it, and took him.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Zimri</hi> had gotten the Crown, he did rend and teare like a Lyon; but preſently God ſtirred the people to ſet up <hi>Omri</hi> to be King, who hunted that Lyon into a fiery pit, 1 <hi>K.</hi> 16. <hi>Saul</hi> plaid the Lyon in his reign, and at laſt he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſlain, and taken by the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> 1 Sam. 31. <hi>Jehoram</hi> became a young Lyon, prey'd upon his brethren, devoured them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.4. And the Lord ſtir'd up the ſpirit of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> againſt him, who came and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him and his, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16.17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was a ramping and roaring Lyon, he brake the bones of many, and ſuckt much blood, and he was taken in the pit of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> 2 Chr. 33.</p>
                     <p>When the Rulers and Potentates of the earth oppreſſe and tyrannize over the people, God in his wiſe providence ſets ſome a work to catch &amp; cruſh them, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.10.11. One way or other their ſtrength is brought down, and they ſuffer for their oppreſſions, and are cut off by violent and untimely deaths. <hi>Tyberius</hi> was poyſoned or ſmothered by his own Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; <hi>Caligula</hi> ſlain by his own guard; <hi>Vitrellius</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:61577:301"/> in battle, taken priſoner, and drawn with an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his neck along the ſtreets halfe naked; and after many outrages done unto him, he was kil'd and caſt into <hi>Tyber.</hi> Fitz-Herbert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leander,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Cyrena,</hi> was taken alive, and being ſewed into a leathern bagg, was caſt into the Sea. Thirty Tyrants were ſlain in one day at <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Theramenes, Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibulus,</hi> and <hi>Archippus,</hi> who did it with 70. men.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Princes who by covetouſneſſe and cruelty ſpoile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their eſtates and liberties, through the juſt judgment of God, come themſelves to be deprived of their eſtates and liberties. <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> he catch'd the prey, and himſelfe was caught and made a prey; he devoured men, and himſelf was devoured; he fettered, chain'd others, and himſelf was put in chains; he loſt his Kingdom and Liberty; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> tooke him, bound him, carryed him to Aegypt: This was he whom <hi>Jeremie</hi> calls <hi>Shallum,</hi> Chap. 22.11, 12. and ſaith he ſhould return no more, but dye in his captivity. It was a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, a ſad judgement to be taken and carryed out of his owne Land, and to dye in a prophane land amongſt <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> therefore it's ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>Weepe ſoare for him that goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for he ſhall return no more, nor ſee his native Countrey.</hi> Such judgments do Princes bring upon themſelves; to ſatisfie ſome baſe and bloody luſts, they hazrid all, yea oft do loſe their Kingdoms, liberties and lives, whereas they might be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if they would keep within their bounds, yea live and dy comfortably in their own Lands: but when they dealt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with others, hook, fetter, and ſpoile them, God meets with them, <hi>Amos</hi> 1.2.

                     <p>The over-much love of States, of Mothers to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is the undoing of them; they ſet them up who teare out their own bowels. When an Aſtrologer told <hi>Agrippina</hi> that <hi>Nero</hi> her ſonne ſhould be Emperour, but withall that

Such as men live amongſt and converſe with all, ſuch they prove; <hi>he went up and downe among the lyons, and became a lyon:</hi> thoſe Lions he converſed with, talked of inriching themſelves, by laying taxes, rates and burthens upon the people, by taking them out of the way who ſhould oppoſe, of making themſelves great, of having their wils, &amp; ruling by prerogative, and theſe things &amp; ſuch like were ſoon learnt by this whelp. When <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> was among beaſts he became bruitiſh, and did as they did. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of a woman brought to a Serpentine and poyſonous nature, by feeding on Serpents ordinarily; and thoſe converſe with a generation of vipers,<note place="margin">In vita Alex.

Ill company is the Dalila that bewitches, defiles, undoes many in their eſtates, names, bodies and ſoules; men that have infectious diſeaſes you wil not come near, you love your bodies, your lives. Wicked company have infectious vices, come not near them, neither your ſelves nor your children, love your ſouls &amp; theirs too.

They converſe with wicked ones do not only become wicked, but many times they prove eminently wicked, they are skilful in wickedneſſe, they exceed their teachers. <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi> by his converſe with Lyons, became not only a Lyon to catch the prey, but ſuch an one as devoured men, defil'd widows, made deſolate Pallaces, laid waſt Cities, &amp; the land alſo. He tyranniz'd ſo, that he went beyond other Tyrants; he was <hi>artifex ſceleris,</hi> and profited above others in his way, and came to a perfection of iniquity. It's incident to mans nature to out-ſtrip one the other, if not in good, yet eſpecially in evill: It's ſaid of this <hi>Jehoiachim,</hi> 2 King. 23.37. <hi>He did that which was evill in the ſight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.</hi> Take any, or all his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, he did evill according to all they did.</p>

When God is in his fury, yet he ſhewes ſome mercy: Although he pluck'd up this Vine, threw her down to the ground, dryed up her fruit by an Eaſt-wind, brake of her ſtrong rods, conſumed them in the fire, yet ſomething of this Vine he ſpared and planted in the Wilderneſſe, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſome branches of it were carryed to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſet there, which was mercie.

                     <p>This Vine was <hi>planted in a good ſoile,</hi> Ezek. 17.8. <hi>By many waters,</hi> Verſ. 10. of this Chapter: <hi>but ſhee brought not forth good fruit,</hi> therefore God pluckt her up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd her of thoſe mercies and meanes ſhe formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and <hi>planted her in a dry and thirſty land.</hi> Deut. 28.47, 48. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord with joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gladneſſe of heart for the abundance of all things.
